I find that troubling.&#8221;   >Even in a region where power rarely changes hands through elections, Iraq has proved a dangerous place to rule.   >Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, it was created as a state by imperial Britain after World War One and ruled by British-backed monarchs until a military coup in 1958 when the king, crown prince and prime minister were all killed.   >The man who staged that coup, Brigadier Abdul-Karim Kassem, was himself toppled and killed in 1963. The next president died in an air crash and was succeeded by his brother, who was exiled after a coup in 1968 by the Baath party.   >President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, who resigned in 1979 when Saddam officially became president -- formalizing the control Saddam had already seized -- died suspiciously three years later, sparking speculation that his successor had him poisoned.   >&#8220;If you think of &#8216;58, &#8216;68 and &#8216;79, you can now put 2006 on this list -- a propagandistic show trial, a quick execution and a claim that this marks a watershed in Iraqi history,&#8221; said Toby Dodge, an Iraq expert at Queen Mary, University of London.   >Saddam had intimate knowledge of assassins -- as a young man he himself fired at Kassem in 1959 in a botched bid to kill the then leader. As president, Saddam took elaborate precautions, including using body doubles. The crimes for which he was executed were reprisals for a failed assassination bid in 1982.   >&#8220;CURSED COUNTRY&#8221;   >Businessman Atheer Abdullah, 43, said Iraq, which has the world&#8217;s third biggest oil reserves and two major rivers, should be a prosperous country but had squandered its natural wealth.   >&#8220;It is a cursed country with a cursed history,&#8221; he said as he waited at Baghdad airport to fly to Jordan where he now lives.   >&#8220;It&#8217;s a country that two-thirds of the population flees at every regime change and the rest are in prison or killed or living in misery.&#8221;   >Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has seen his fragile authority among fellow Shi&#8216;ites enhanced after he forced through Saddam&#8217;s execution just four days after the appeal court upheld his conviction over the killing and torture of Shi&#8216;ites.   >But many Sunni Arabs and Saddam&#8217;s defense team have accused Maliki of political interference in the trial, which was widely criticized as unfair by international human rights groups.   >Sectarian passions that have pushed Iraq toward civil war since U.S. troops overthrew Saddam in 2003 could be further inflamed by video posted on the Internet showing Shi&#8216;ite officials taunting him as he stood on the gallows on Saturday.   >Iraqi state television showed film of Saddam being prepared for death, but stopped short of showing the actual moment of death. However the full video was circulated on the Internet.   >Dodge said the showing of the execution &#8220;conforms to a brutal logic that Saddam Hussein used himself&#8221;.   >&#8220;This isn&#8217;t even victor&#8217;s justice, this is the tawdry work of an insecure government,&#8221; Dodge said.   >Amid reports that his U.S. backers are losing patience with him, Maliki has dismissed public speculation of a coup and said it would be folly to replace him.   >President Bush has said the invasion of Iraq is part of a wider goal to spread democracy in the Middle East and he hailed elections in 2005 as the start of a new era.   >But according to U.N. figures, more than 3,000 civilians are being killed every month in spiraling sectarian violence.   >Some mourners at Saddam&#8217;s grave promised revenge.   >The video of the hanging inspired some discomfort even in places such as Arbil, a Kurdish city whose people, long oppressed and attacked by Saddam, had every reason to celebrate.   >&#8220;It showed that we still have the culture of revenge in Iraq,&#8221; said Sara Baban, 35. &#8220;It brought to mind the scenes of executions of Iraqi officials in years gone by.&#8221;   >(Additional reporting by David Cutler in London, Mariam Karouny in Baghdad, Imad al-Khuzaie in Diwaniya and Shamal Aqrawi in Arbil)   >* to see a chronology of Iraqi leaders please click on | after, start, a

GT.N have voted to end a three-month-old strike, ratifying a contract that will save the biggest U.S. tire maker as much as $610 million by cutting production and health-care costs, both sides said on Friday.   >More than 10,000 United Steelworkers (USWA) members voted on the contract, approving it by a margin of more than two-to-one, the union said in a statement. All striking workers are set to return to work starting on January 2, ending a walkout that began October 5.   >The new three-year contract establishes a company-financed trust fund of more than $1 billion that will secure medical and prescription drug benefits for current and future retirees, the union said. The company also agreed to invest $550 million in union-represented plants.   >&#8220;It took a strike, but we achieved a fair and equitable contract that protects quality health care for active and retired members,&#8221; USWA Executive Vice President Ron Hoover said in a statement. &#8220;And by winning major capital investment expenditures, it secures our jobs for the future.&#8221;   >Goodyear said that the trust fund will reduce a significant portion of its costs related to its retirees. The company said its $1 billion upfront contribution will consist of at least $700 million in cash, with the balance in additional cash or common stock.   >Under provisions of the three-year contract, which covers workers at 12 tire and engineered products plants, Goodyear will save up to $610 million in costs, and $300 million a year in ongoing savings, the company said in a statement.   >&#8220;Reaching agreement on a contract that competitively positions Goodyear for the future is a huge achievement for everyone involved in the negotiation process,&#8221; Goodyear Chief Executive Robert Keegan said in a statement.   >Goodyear expects savings to total $70 million in 2007, $240 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2009.   >J.P. Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel, who reiterated his &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Goodyear&#8217;s stock, said the contract savings were sharply higher than he had expected.   >&#8220;The &#8216;09 savings run-rate is roughly twice our prior expectations, with most of the upside coming from &#8216;increased productivity,&#8217; reflecting the benefit of lower wages for new hires and incentives designed to increase productivity of existing workers,&#8221; he said in a research note.   >Goodyear and the union reached a tentative agreement last week to end the strike by 15,000 union workers in the United States and Canada, and announced the deal early Friday morning.   >Last month, the company said it was losing up to $35 million a week due to the strike.   >The Akron, Ohio-based company said under the deal it can pay lower wages and benefits for new hires during the first three years of employment.   >Goodyear will close its plant in Tyler, Texas, after December 31, 2007, instead of immediately, as it had wanted. This will eliminate 9 million units of high-cost tire capacity and yield about $50 million in annual savings.   >When the plant closes, the company said it will have eliminated 14 million units of high-cost tire capacity out of a targeted 15 million to 20 million.   >Goodyear also said it has agreed to profit-sharing of up to $25 million in 2009, and up to $30 million in 2010.   >Workers at four Goodyear union facilities in Canada were voting Thursday and Friday, and no results were immediately available.

He&#8217;s in Vienna at 2 a.m. and his yearning to see the performance taking place at the Metropolitan Opera in New York is instantly fulfilled by switching on a television.   >The renowned Spanish tenor&#8217;s dream may not be far from reality in the digital age.   >Domingo is singing in one of six Met operas scheduled in coming months to have a performance broadcast live to an audience of tens of thousands in movie theaters across the United States, Canada, Britain, Denmark, Norway and Japan.   >The first high-definition broadcast of the series, called &#8220;Metropolitan Opera: Live in HD,&#8221; begins on Saturday with Mozart&#8217;s &#8220;The Magic Flute.&#8221; Based on advanced ticket sales, it could reach more than 30,000 people.   >It may not yet be Domingo&#8217;s dream of watching opera live anywhere at any time, but the move by the 123-year-old New York institution to broadcast live via satellite to more than 150 cinemas worldwide is its latest effort to expand opera&#8217;s global audience.   >&#8220;With this new public, they will be exposed to opera, maybe they will go to the cinema and they are tempted,&#8221; said the 65-year-old Domingo, who helped bridge classes and cultures when he sang with Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras in &#8220;The Three Tenors Concert&#8221; for the 1990 soccer World Cup.   >Domingo said the cinema broadcasts would not only please opera lovers in foreign cities who cannot attend the opera in person, but also help gain new fans for what some see as an elitist domain.   >&#8220;There are two kinds of public that don&#8217;t go to the opera,&#8221; the silver-haired conductor and tenor told Reuters on a break from rehearsing at the Met for his starring role in &#8220;The First Emperor,&#8221; to be broadcast in cinemas January 13.   >&#8220;People that cannot afford it -- for them it is a more difficult problem,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But for people who say they don&#8217;t like it, maybe simply for them they have not been exposed.

Around the same time, it launched a 24-hour satellite radio channel featuring live and archived broadcasts.   >The man behind it all, the Met&#8217;s general manager Peter Gelb, put it simply upon launching the cinema series: &#8220;Opera will now enter the digital era.&#8221;   >Gelb told Reuters the opera world could learn from the marketing approach of other entertainment forms without losing its core audience.   >Faced with falling ticket sales since 2001, Gelb said new labor agreements cut the Met&#8217;s cost of operas by half and gave the institution control of electronic content.   >&#8220;We are creating an opera equivalent of a movie rollout,&#8221; Gelb said, of the different mass media initiatives introduced in his first year on the job.   >&#8221;It would be foolish to say that opera is for everybody, but its potential is as broad as the sophisticated modern theater and films that have a significant global audience.   >&#8220;If somebody can see a play or show on Broadway then they should be able to see a well-produced opera,&#8221; he said.   >Gelb is not alone in his vision.   >Sitting in the Met&#8217;s cafeteria on a break from rehearsal, &#8220;The First Emperor&#8221; composer and conductor Tan Dun talked of opera houses around the world collaborating to reach new, larger audiences.   >&#8220;My dream is there will be 10,000 opera houses that will perform this opera,&#8221; said Dun, whose opera has been inspired by music from the East and West. &#8220;What we need to do now is new things, changing everybody&#8217;s view, changing the market.&#8221;   >But if opera becomes as commercial as Broadway or as mainstream as Hollywood, won&#8217;t it lose some of its magic?   >Domingo, whose upcoming book, &#8220;The Joy of Opera,&#8221; touches on his vision for the future of opera, said he doesn&#8217;t think so.   >&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it will ever be a real business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I just dream that, yes, it is normal that everybody can connect to it ... if you want to hear an important performance.

His daughter Raghd, who helped finance his defense from her strictly supervised exile in Jordan, joined several hundred people in the capital Amman in a show of solidarity.   >Iraqi troops and police rushed to Mosul&#8217;s Padush prison to put down a riot after visitors broke news of Saddam&#8217;s treatment. The governor said seven guards and three prisoners were injured although a visitor reported gunfire and the death of an inmate.   >There has been no significant repeat of the series of car bombings that killed over 70 people in Shi&#8216;ite neighborhoods on Saturday within hours of the dawn execution, but the government and U.S. forces are on alert for the kind of sectarian violence that has pitched Iraq toward civil war since Saddam&#8217;s overthrow.   >Interior ministry data showed the number of Iraqi civilians killed in political violence hit a new record high in December after a big leap the previous month. The statistics, almost certain to be an underestimate, showed 12,320 civilians were killed in 2006 in what officials termed &#8220;terrorist&#8221; violence.   >The Interior Ministry ordered the closure of another Iraqi television channel, Sharkiya, accusing it of fomenting hatred. The channel, owned by a London-based businessman who was once an official under Saddam, continued broadcasting from Dubai.   >Volunteers carry empty coffins draped in U.S. flags at Arlington West in Santa Monica December 31, 2006, to honor the 3,000th soldier killed in Iraq.

At least 112 Americans died in December, the deadliest month for them in more than two years as they struggled to contain the bloodshed.   >Two U.S. soldiers died in an explosion on Sunday northeast of Baghdad.

The dirt streets lined with boarded-up houses are deserted. Those that are inhabited have skewed window panes and broken gates.   >Dalekushi is typical of huge swaths of the Russian countryside -- except that in this village, a young priest, his wife and their three young children last month burned to death in their home.   >It was the second time in two years a house occupied by Andrei Nikolayev had burned down. While the cause of the first fire remains unknown, most local villagers say the repeat was arson. National media said local drunks were behind it.   >As investigators work out the facts of the family&#8217;s death, Russia&#8217;s media have found in it a signal of deeper nationwide malaise.   >&#8220;It is time to recognize the fact that rural life...has died. Spiritually and physically,&#8221; the popular Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper said in one of many editorials that appeared in the Russian press after Nikolayev&#8217;s death.   >The 31-year old priest and his family were seen as a beacon of hope in the grim reality of joblessness, decay and alcoholism that characterizes rural Russia.   >&#8220;Something has to be done with the Russian countryside. If there are no country people left, that will be the end of Russia,&#8221; the Komsomolskaya Pravda editorial said.   >In a society that until as recently as the 1930s was predominantly rural, many view the countryside as the wellspring of the national identity.   >Some of Russia&#8217;s most revered writers such as Leo Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev often focused on rural life. Today, folk music, traditions and characters -- such as lazy but lucky Ivan the Fool -- retain a strong presence in everyday culture.   >The death of Nikolayev and his young family was a stark reminder that this part of the country&#8217;s makeup is in danger.   >In Moscow, the latest Mercedes limousines whiz past well-dressed pedestrians and chic bars as the capital enjoys a boom fueled by huge energy revenues.   >But recently in Dalekushi -- 280 km (175 miles) northwest of Moscow and by the standards of Russia&#8217;s huge expanses just a short drive from the capital -- the only vehicle in evidence was a broken-down tractor.   >&#8220;Only old people live there.

He was carrying a bucket of water to his house.   >Many villagers in Russia do not have basic amenities such as water and some still heat their homes by burning firewood.   >Country-dwellers account for almost a half of Russia&#8217;s unemployed, yet only about a quarter of the total population.   >While in summer villagers can work on the land, there is little or no work in winter. Many turn to drink. Ambitious young people move to the cities.   >Nikolayev, who appears in photographs a tall, well-built man with a mane of black hair, was portrayed as campaigning against the rot.   >&#8220;He was actively fighting alcoholism...in his sermons he said it would destroy the Russian people,&#8221; a spokeswoman for the regional diocese told Reuters.   >News reports suggested he was killed by local drunks who were trying to steal icons from his church to sell for drink. Nikolayev had told superiors in his diocese there had been attempts to steal the icons.   >&#8220;He guarded the church himself at night,&#8221; the diocese spokeswoman said.   >But villagers say no local would have harmed Nikolayev and reject media claims of lawlessness and alcoholism in their village as untrue or manipulated.   >&#8220;Some (journalists) came, got one guy drunk and started filming him,&#8221; a local shop assistant said.   >Some 200 people from local villages and towns came to Nikolayev&#8217;s funeral and many wept, said Nadezhda Chertoroga, who works in the church where Nikolayev&#8217;s funeral was held.   >The family&#8217;s grave is laden with wreaths from his neighbors, parish and local churches.   >At the burnt-out site of Nikolayev&#8217;s house, red carnations are strewn over the rubble.

In the 2005-2006 period there were 18,528 murders, 54,926 rapes, and 226,942 assaults with grievous bodily harm intended across South Africa, according to the Department of Safety and Security.   >Gauteng province police director Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said security crackdowns have eased crimes in Hillbrow.   >&#8220;We recently arrested 27 people and in another incident 150.

I am tired of trying to find a lawyer for my friend,&#8221; said Natasha Sangweni, who insisted the friend&#8217;s offence was only minor.   >Crime has become so rampant that a continental review board has warned it is a threat to post-apartheid democracy.   >Pastor Joseph Iwundu of the Apostolic Faith Mission has spent a decade trying to convince young men to turn to God. He kept 40 people off Hillbrow&#8217;s streets in the past year but the Nigerian priest says he needs more help from the authorities.   >&#8220;We tell people Jesus is the answer and we direct them to jobs.

I find that troubling.&#8221;   >Even in a region where power rarely changes hands through elections, Iraq has proved a dangerous place to rule.   >Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, it was created as a state by imperial Britain after World War One and ruled by British-backed monarchs until a military coup in 1958 when the king, crown prince and prime minister were all killed.   >The man who staged that coup, Brigadier Abdul-Karim Kassem, was himself toppled and killed in 1963. The next president died in an air crash and was succeeded by his brother, who was exiled after a coup in 1968 by the Baath party.   >President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, who resigned in 1979 when Saddam officially became president -- formalizing the control Saddam had already seized -- died suspiciously three years later, sparking speculation that his successor had him poisoned.   >&#8220;If you think of &#8216;58, &#8216;68 and &#8216;79, you can now put 2006 on this list -- a propagandistic show trial, a quick execution and a claim that this marks a watershed in Iraqi history,&#8221; said Toby Dodge, an Iraq expert at Queen Mary, University of London.   >Saddam had intimate knowledge of assassins -- as a young man he himself fired at Kassem in 1959 in a botched bid to kill the then leader. As president, Saddam took elaborate precautions, including using body doubles. The crimes for which he was executed were reprisals for a failed assassination bid in 1982.   >&#8220;CURSED COUNTRY&#8221;   >Businessman Atheer Abdullah, 43, said Iraq, which has the world&#8217;s third biggest oil reserves and two major rivers, should be a prosperous country but had squandered its natural wealth.   >&#8220;It is a cursed country with a cursed history,&#8221; he said as he waited at Baghdad airport to fly to Jordan where he now lives.   >&#8220;It&#8217;s a country that two-thirds of the population flees at every regime change and the rest are in prison or killed or living in misery.&#8221;   >Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has seen his fragile authority among fellow Shi&#8216;ites enhanced after he forced through Saddam&#8217;s execution just four days after the appeal court upheld his conviction over the killing and torture of Shi&#8216;ites.   >But many Sunni Arabs and Saddam&#8217;s defense team have accused Maliki of political interference in the trial, which was widely criticized as unfair by international human rights groups.   >Sectarian passions that have pushed Iraq toward civil war since U.S. troops overthrew Saddam in 2003 could be further inflamed by video posted on the Internet showing Shi&#8216;ite officials taunting him as he stood on the gallows on Saturday.   >Iraqi state television showed film of Saddam being prepared for death, but stopped short of showing the actual moment of death.

Tight monetary and fiscal policies sent financial markets soaring during Lula&#8217;s first-term but helped brake growth.   >Lula said in his congressional address that he would cut red tape, provide tax incentives for private investment and boost public investment.   >Lula said an economic stimulus package later this month would be followed by measures to expand infrastructure projects and improve regulatory frameworks.   >Investors often complain about red tape, legal uncertainty and government intervention in industry regulators.   >Critics say Lula has not agreed to slash large government expenditures, which economists say are the principal obstacle to lower stifling taxes and interest rates.   >The charismatic former factory worker is still hugely popular among Brazil&#8217;s 185 million people.

Shortly after the fighters of the hardline religious movement fled, residents looted their arsenals.   >The government has now given thousands of militia three days to disarm, or be disarmed by force, and has promised to help former fighters join the police or military, or find other work.   >Businessmen said that would have to happen fast if Mogadishu&#8217;s new rulers expect them to lay down their arms.   >&#8220;I have six guards with AK-47s. If the government gives me a guarantee my store will not be broken into, then I will hand over my guns,&#8221; food importer Farah Isse said. &#8220;It will be a good idea if the government employs all militias, including mine.&#8221;   >Many Somalis said the government had a long way to go to disarm a city of one million, and solve the root problem behind Mogadishu&#8217;s rule of the gun -- crushing poverty.   >&#8220;That is why we have been in chaos in the past years,&#8221; restaurant worker Ali Osman said. &#8220;If the government quickly takes charge, opens the seaport and airport and provides jobs for the thousands of youths used as militiamen, then calm will return and we will enjoy peace.&#8221;   >One of the last U.S.-backed warlords to surrender to the Islamists in the battle for Mogadishu, Abdi Hassan Awale -- popularly known as Qaybdiid -- told a news conference his days of violence were finally behind him.   >&#8220;Weapons are the enemy of Somalia, including the ones I have. Will we keep the enemy of Somalia, or leave it? We will lay it down,&#8221; Qaybdiid said on Monday. &#8220;The time of warlords is over. What is here is a time of reconciliation.&#8221;   >Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi, who entered his Horn of Africa hometown in victory on Friday, said his administration would not recognize any warlords.   >&#8220;We do not deal with warlords and the warlord era in Somalia has ended,&#8221; he told reporters on Monday.   >As he spoke, his Ethiopian-backed forces were in pursuit of the fleeing leaders of the Islamist movement who brought stability by enforcing strictly Muslim sharia law, but angered Mogadishu residents by shutting cinemas, holding public executions and banning the widely used mild narcotic qat.   >As the New Year brought an end of nearly two weeks of war, many remained to be convinced by the government&#8217;s promises.   >&#8220;We are at a crossroads,&#8221; said taxi driver Mahamud Mohamed. &#8220;Nobody has taken over the whole country.

We have to get candidate status by the end of 2007.&#8221;   >The EU froze talks on a pre-membership association agreement with Belgrade in May, after Serbia failed to meet the latest in a string of deadlines to track down and extradite Mladic.   >The former general faces charges over the 1995 Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys and the siege of Sarajevo that killed 10,000 during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia.   >The chief U.N. prosecutor says he is living in Serbia, but Belgrade insists it cannot find him.   >Tadic said cooperation with the tribunal was unavoidable. Serbia will get positive marks, he said, &#8220;if Ratko Mladic is arrested in Serbia or it is proven he is not in Serbia.&#8221;   >The West has pinned its hopes on Tadic&#8217;s Democratic Party doing well in the January 21 election and forming a coalition that will continue post-Slobodan Milosevic reforms, arrest Mladic and take a constructive approach to the breakaway Kosovo province.   >Analysts predict a pro-Western coalition led by Tadic&#8217;s party and including most of Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica&#8217;s outgoing centre-right government.   >A U.N. decision on whether to grant independence to the Albanian-majority province of Kosovo is expected in the spring. The major powers let slip a year-end deadline to avoid making the possible loss of the territory an election winner for ultranationalists who would slam the brakes on reforms.   >Kosovo has been run by the United Nations since 1999, when NATO bombed to drive out Serb forces accused of killing and expelling ethnic Albanians in a two-year war with guerrillas.   >Unlike his political rival Kostunica, Tadic has tried to brace Serbs for Kosovo&#8217;s possible independence, with or without Serbian consent.   >&#8220;I will not sign such a solution.

Unofficial estimates put Roma population at up to 10 percent of Bulgaria&#8217;s total population.   >RELIGION: Eastern Orthodox Christianity is practised by 83 percent of Bulgarians, while 12 percent are Muslims.   >LANGUAGE: The official language is Bulgarian.   >AREA: 110,994 sq km (42,855 sq miles).   >Bulgaria is bordered to the north by Romania, to the east by the Black Sea, to the south by Turkey and Greece, to the west by Serbia and Macedonia.   >CAPITAL: Sofia. Population 1.2 million.   >ECONOMY: The Bulgarian economy is growing strongly due to robust domestic consumption and an improving business sentiment which is drawing in hefty foreign investment.   >Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev said earlier in December the government will raise its 2006 economic growth forecast to 6.2-6.3 percent, saying the economy should expand by the fastest rate in 20 years.   >Despite its fast expansion, Bulgaria will be the poorest country in the EU and it is struggling with weak infrastructure and outdated technology.   >Strong imports are also putting pressure on its current account deficit which the International Monetary Fund says could reach as much as 15 percent of GDP this year.   >Bulgaria is running a tight fiscal stance, and its Socialist-led cabinet is pledging to aim for a budget surplus of at least 2 percent of GDP.   >Bulgaria also operates under a currency board regime, which significantly curtails central bank operations.   >POPULATION: 21.68 million: 89.5 percent ethnic Romanians, seven percent ethnic Hungarians, 2.5 percent Roma. Unofficial estimates say the Roma represent five to 10 percent of the population. Roma are usually considered Romanian under the census.   >There are smaller German, Ukrainian and other minorities.   >RELIGION: More than 86.8 percent of Romanians belong to the Orthodox Church, about 4.7 percent are Roman Catholics, 3.5 percent Protestants, one percent Greek-Catholics and around 13,000 Jews.   >LANGUAGE: The official language is Romanian but ethnic minorities typically speak their own languages, such as Hungarian and Romany.   >AREA: 237,500 sq km (91,699 sq miles). Romania is bordered to the north and northeast by Ukraine and Moldova, to the east by the Black Sea, to the south by Bulgaria, to the southwest by Serbia and Montenegro and northwest by Hungary.   >CAPITAL: Bucharest: Population 2 million.   >ECONOMY: Romania&#8217;s economy beat expectations in the third quarter to grow by 8.3 percent on the year, propelled by strong domestic spending and investment ahead of the country&#8217;s EU accession.   >Consumption is expected to stay strong as Romanians rush to improve their living standards, while companies modernise to compete within the EU and government spends to upgrade weak infrastructure.   >Growth has rebounded after massive floods hit output in 2005 and record foreign direct investment is propping up the local economy.   >But Romania is struggling to come up with projects that would allow it to absorb billions in EU aid cash and modernise its ex-communist economy. | percent, million., its

A no-holds-barred Internet video of the execution has inflamed already fiery sectarian passions.   >&#8220;The Americans wanted to delay the execution by 15 days because they weren&#8217;t keen on having him executed straight away,&#8221; said the senior Iraqi official, who was involved in the events leading to Saddam&#8217;s death and spoke on condition of anonymity.   >&#8220;But during the day (on Friday) the prime minister&#8217;s office provided all the documents they asked for and the Americans changed their minds when they saw the prime minister was very insistent. Then it was just a case of finalizing the details.&#8221;   >A U.S. embassy spokesman declined immediate comment.   >U.S. forces handed over Saddam only at the last moment before he was hanged at dawn, following late-night negotiations between Shi&#8216;ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and senior U.S. officials, several Iraqi government sources have said.   >U.S. officials, whose troops had physical custody of Saddam for three years, have declined comment on their role in the execution. It was rushed through only four days after an appeal court upheld Saddam&#8217;s conviction for crimes against humanity.   >Officials only confirmed the hanging would go ahead just four hours before Saddam went to the gallows shortly after 6 a.m. Two aides convicted with him will not be hanged till later.   >The senior Iraqi official said U.S. ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad told Maliki on Friday he would not hand over the 69- year-old ousted strongman unless Maliki produced key documents, including a signed authorization from President Jalal Talabani and a death warrant signed by the prime minister.   >Two Iraqi cabinet ministers said on Friday two legal issues were holding up any hanging -- first whether a presidential decree was required and second whether the start of the Eid al- Adha Muslim holiday on Saturday should stay the execution, a provision of the Saddam-era Iraqi Penal Code.   >Talabani has been reluctant to sign death warrants for personal reasons but the constitution gives him no power of pardon for war crimes. Many of his fellow Kurds were also keen to see Saddam convicted of genocide against them.   >In the end, officials said, presidency advisers provided a letter simply stating that no presidential decree was needed and that senior clerics told Maliki the holiday provided no grace.   >Maliki was shown on state television signing the death warrant in red ink in images released by his office along with film of the hangman placing the noose around Saddam&#8217;s neck.   >The rapid execution has boosted Maliki&#8217;s fragile authority among his fractious Shi&#8216;ite supporters but angered many Sunnis.   >The United States has been keen to stem a Sunni insurgency that has caused most of the 3,000 American deaths in Iraq and to persuade the dominant Shi&#8216;ites not alienate Saddam&#8217;s minority but to bring them into power to avert an all-out civil war.   >That has irritated some leading Shi&#8216;ites who accused the Afghan-born Khalilzad of sympathizing with fellow Sunni Muslims.   >Some U.S. officials have privately expressed frustration with the sway held over Maliki&#8217;s government by radical Shi&#8216;ites like cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose Mehdi Army militia has been blamed for many sectarian death squad attacks on Sunnis.   >U.S. officials may also be embarrassed by the revelation of rowdy conduct by Shi&#8216;ite guards in the execution chamber where Saddam&#8217;s own enemies were once frequently put to death.   >Grainy video apparently shot on a mobile phone surfaced on the Internet after the official footage, showing observers exchanging taunts with Saddam that including chanting &#8220;Moqtada, Moqtada, Moqtada!&#8221;.   >&#8220;There were a few guards who shouted slogans that were inappropriate and that&#8217;s now the subject of a government investigation,&#8221; Sami al-Askari, an adviser to Maliki and one of the official observers, told Reuters on Monday.   >&#8220;They have damaged the image of the Sadrists. That should not have happened. Before we went into the room we had an agreement that no one should bring a mobile phone.&#8221;   >No Americans were present in the chamber itself, he said.   >There was further U.S. involvement afterwards, however, when the government agreed to hand Saddam&#8217;s body over to his tribe for burial in his native village. Some officials had proposed burying him next to the co-founder of his Baath party, Michel Aflaq, who lies inside the Green Zone government compound. In the end, a U.S. military helicopter flew the body to Tikrit. | only, the, Internet

I can say no more.&#8221;   >British forces in the southern oil province of Basra have also been conducting major raids against groups they describe as &#8220;rogue Mehdi Army&#8221;, some entrenched in Iraqi police units.   >Last week, British troops blew up the headquarters of Basra&#8217;s Major Crimes Unit and said they freed tortured prisoners.   >&#8220;The Americans want a war with the Mehdi Army,&#8221; said a Western diplomat in Baghdad, who is not American or British.   >&#8220;They want to get rid of the militia and it seems they will succeed in getting one.&#8221;   >Sadr&#8217;s supporters twice launched armed uprisings against the U.S. occupation in 2004 but have since formally joined the U.S.-sponsored political process.   >A handful of Sadr&#8217;s ministers suspended their participation in Maliki&#8217;s government and his 30 members of parliament have also been staying away since Maliki approved a renewal of the U.S. forces&#8217; U.N. mandate a month ago.   >But Maliki&#8217;s fragile authority among his fellow Shi&#8216;ite&#8217;s has been bolstered by Saturday&#8217;s hanging of Saddam Hussein, whose Sunni-led administration oppressed the Shi&#8216;ite majority.   >While he negotiates to end a boycott of the cabinet by moderates in Sadr&#8217;s movement, other Shi&#8216;ite leaders are pushing for a crackdown on Sadr militants.   >&#8220;They are jeopardizing all our efforts and achievements,&#8221; said a senior official from another group in the main United Alliance bloc of which Sadr&#8217;s group is a key part.   >Hundreds of Iraqis are being killed every week and hundreds of thousands have fled. Many Sunnis accuse Sadr&#8217;s movement of being behind many death squad killings, a charge Sadr himself denies. They also accuse them of being controlled by Washington&#8217;s enemies in neighboring, Shi&#8216;ite Islamist Iran.   >Impressions among Sunnis of being victims of triumphal Shi&#8216;ite militias have been reinforced by video of Saddam&#8217;s hanging, in which official observers chanted &#8220;Moqtada, Moqtada, Moqtada!&#8221; and taunted the former leader on the gallows.   >Maliki has repeatedly said since taking office eight months ago that he will disband all militias but has asked for patience and insists the main threat is from Sunni insurgents.   >Several political sources said Maliki, from the Dawa party and a compromise choice as premier who owed his appointment to support from the populist Sadr, was trying to give political negotiations with Sadr a last chance before any crackdown.   >Last month, a government delegation to Najaf failed to persuade the cleric to end his boycott, however, and Maliki has said he still plans a cabinet reshuffle that government officials say could involve removing some Sadrist ministers.   >The head of the Sadrists bloc in the parliament said the group was working with members in the Alliance on a proposal to reschedule the timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops which then will end their boycott of the parliament.   >&#8220;In response to our demands we are working with others in the Alliance on a proposal for the timetable of withdrawal. This will help ending the boycott,&#8221; Nassar al Rubaie told Reuters.   >Rubaie accused U.S. commanders of trying to lure Sadr into a direct confrontation but said that he would not be provoked.   >But other members of the Alliance said Sadr had no choice but more clearly to disown militant Mehdi Army commanders. He has done so more than once, and even arrested some, but critics remain unconvinced that Sadr is genuine in those efforts:   >&#8220;These people will only respond to force and this is what they will get,&#8221; the senior Alliance official said. &#8220;A decisive battle is not agreed yet but limited operations just began.&#8221;   >(Additional reporting by Alastair Macdonald)    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Editing by Dominic Evans | will, Basra, is

I bring my sons with me normally (for protection), but this year I found I was okay without them,&#8221; said Saadiya Mustafa from Egypt.   >&#8220;The organization has been great,&#8221; said Indian pilgrim Sayed Yousef, sitting on top of a van amid severe traffic congestion on the final day of haj. &#8220;I was here two years ago, but this time there was more free food and less hassle.&#8221;   >On Monday, pilgrims made a third and final visit to the Jamarat Bridge to throw stones at three large walls representing the spot of Satan&#8217;s temptation of biblical patriarch Abraham.   >Then many jumped on whatever transport they could find to make a final visit to Mecca&#8217;s Grand Mosque, which filled with hundreds of thousands of pilgrims into the evening.   >&#8220;Look at the pedestrians, they are moving faster than the cars,&#8221; said Hamdan bin Musaileh, a Yemeni stuck in the suffocating traffic jam. &#8220;I bet they get a better reward from God for walking to the Mosque rather than taking transport.&#8221;   >Authorities congratulated themselves that the haj rites had passed off without incident despite a surge of pilgrims at the bridge on Monday in the rush to finish and leave.   >&#8220;There have been no security violations at all at the Jamarat area,&#8221; Interior Minister Prince Nayef told reporters, praising Saudi clerics for offering pilgrims clear advice to pace the stoning throughout the day.   >Hardliners of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Wahhabi school of Islam often insist stoning should take place in the afternoon to emulate to the word what they say was the practice of Prophet Mohammad.   >It was on the final day of the last haj that 362 pilgrims were crushed to death during the stone-throwing ritual in the worst haj tragedy in 16 years. Another such incident would have been an embarrassment for Saudi Arabia.   >New construction work completed in recent months allows 250,000 pilgrims to pass over the Jamarat Bridge each hour. Saudi authorities were also bolder than normal in removing pilgrim squatters who set up makeshift tents in the area.   >Saudi Arabia regularly deploys more than 50,000 security men to safeguard haj against militants and try to prevent disasters.   >The 5-day rites were overshadowed by the hanging on Saturday of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, a hero to some Sunni Arabs over his anti-U.S. stances, but hated by many Shi&#8216;ites.   >Saudi Arabia criticized Iraq for despoiling the spirit of the haj, one of the world&#8217;s biggest displays of mass religious devotion which is a duty for able-bodied Muslims with the means.   >The execution also raised fears of clashes at the haj, where police have used force to put down protests in the past.   >Security was already tight during this pilgrimage season -- with apparent record numbers -- because of sectarian strife between Sunni and Shi&#8216;ite Muslims in Iraq and Lebanon.   >Saudi officials say 2.4 million pilgrims are officially on the haj. But with hundreds of thousands of residents and expatriates sneaking into Mecca without official permits, the total number could be closer to a record 3 million.   >Pilgrims, mostly on foot, cover a 44 km (28 mile) route around Mecca during the grueling rites, as well as walk some 15 km in at least three visits to the city&#8217;s vast mosque complex. | Grand, spot, Sunni

The Interior Ministry ordered two television stations off the air in November when Saddam was convicted on the grounds they were inciting violence.   >One of those channels was controlled by a prominent Sunni Arab politician and the other is based in Saddam&#8217;s Sunni home region. The government already bans pan-Arab news station Al Jazeera and forced its main rival, Al-Arabiya, to shut its Baghdad bureau for a month in September.   >Al Jazeera&#8217;s new English-language service has started reporting from Baghdad.   >Iraq&#8217;s Sunni Arab minority, which enjoyed political power and patronage under Saddam, has lost power since his overthrow by U.S. troops, with Shi&#8216;ites and ethnic Kurds dominating the U.S.-backed political process.   >Sharkiya has been seen by many as one of the more independent channels among an array of local and national outlets, most of which are overtly controlled by political parties and factions. It is owned by businessman Saad al-Bazaz, who also owns a widely read daily newspaper, Azzaman.   >Bazaz is a former Baath party member and senior media official who left Iraq in the 1990s.   >As with other media, several journalists and employees of Sharkiya have been killed, including one of Iraq&#8217;s best known satirists, Waleed Hassan, who was shot dead in November.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Wathiq Ibrahim | which, Reuters,, not
