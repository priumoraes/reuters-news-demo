It is building a second plant in the city, to add 200,000 units of capacity by early 2008, increasing to 300,000 units by the end of that year.   > But until then, the venture would not aggressively roll out new models -- an effective way to lure customers in the world&#8217;s second-largest and hotly-contested auto market, another company executive said.   > Hyundai, which competes with Toyota Motor Corp. (7203.T) and others in China, had made headway in Beijing and surrounding areas, helped largely by its hot-selling mid-range Elantra sedan.   > However, it has seen weaker sales in Shanghai, the homebase of the local ventures of Volkswagen AG (VOWG.DE) and General Motors Corp.

Analysts had forecast a reading of 49.9.  The data reinforced expectations for a soft-landing in the U.S. economy and lent support to the dollar, said Kikuko Takeda, currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.   > Pessimism has been receding and it seems all right to think a soft-landing is the main scenario, said Takeda.  The dollar was at 119.35 yen JPY= as of 0300 GMT, little changed from the level in late U.S. trading on Wednesday, when it rose to a 2-&#189;   month high of 119.68 yen.   > The euro was nearly flat at $1.3172 EUR=, after falling 0.9 percent on Wednesday, its biggest one-day decline since mid-July of last year.   > The euro was flat at 157.22 yen EURJPY=R after hitting a record high of 158.06 yen on electronic trading platform EBS on Wednesday.   > Market players said the yen continued to look vulnerable after also having fallen to fresh eight-year lows against sterling GBPJPY=R and nine-year lows versus the Australian dollar AUDJPY=R this week, dragged down by its low-yielding status.   > Such falls in the yen occurred despite the possibility of the Bank of Japan raising interest rates as early as the two-day policy meeting that starts on Jan. 17.   > Even if the BOJ boosts rates this month, the yen&#8217;s weak trend is unlikely to be reversed, traders and analysts said, adding that any subsequent hikes would probably come only gradually.   > &#8220;Even if rates are raised in January or February, I think the consensus (market) view is that any subsequent action is only likely to be taken after the upper house elections,&#8221; said Takeda at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, referring to parliamentary elections in July.   > Japan&#8217;s Yomiuri newspaper reported on Monday that the BOJ will likely consider raising rates as early as this month&#8217;s meeting.   > The Yomiuri said, however, that the decision on a rate hike could be delayed until February or later, depending on &#8220;adjustments&#8221; between the BOJ and the government and ruling parties.   > The BOJ held rates at 0.25 percent at its policy board meeting in December.    | 17., only, meeting

(F.N) is heading into the new year with a highly regarded chief executive, $48 billion in cash, a new crossover utility vehicle expected to prove a hit and the projected savings from the departure of a third of its work force.   >Then there is the bad news: the automaker is mortgaged to the hilt, struggling with the legacy of wobbly product plans and banking on its third turnaround plan in the last five years to deliver sustained profitability.   >With Ford poised to lose its No. 2 spot in the U.S. market to Toyota Motor Corp. (7203.T) in 2007, analysts are weighing the potential payoffs of Ford&#8217;s painful restructuring against the risk posed by its heavy borrowing.   >For now, the pessimism on Wall Street is waning, but analysts caution that it will at least two years before a recovery shows signs of traction.   >&#8220;Ford is a deep turnaround situation,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analyst Jonathan Steinmetz said in a recent note for clients.   >But the building blocks are forming, said Steinmetz, who sees sustainable positive cash flow from Ford&#8217;s auto operations as still four years away.   >A key reason for a turn in Wall Street sentiment is Ford&#8217;s new chief executive, Alan Mulally, a restructuring expert who was lured away from Boeing Co. (BA.N) in September.   >Since Mulally took over from Ford family scion Bill Ford Jr. in October, he has moved to streamline management, appointed a global product chief and raised about $25 billion in cash through liens, bond offerings and credit lines.   >The company has also reached out to Toyota, the increasingly dominant Japanese automaker, which eagerly studied Ford in the 1930s when it was a maker of looms branching out to manufacture cars.   >Analysts say Mulally&#8217;s trip to Tokyo earlier this month to meet Toyota Chairman Fujio Cho might prompt a partnership that would help Ford bring down costs in areas such as parts procurement, technology development and planned plant closures.   >&#8220;You have to ask yourself what would be in it for Toyota. They are doing pretty well on their own. They are on their way to becoming the world&#8217;s largest automaker next year (2007),&#8221; said IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle.   >&#8220;But a joint venture might work. There are some real possibilities there.&#8221;   >Even before Mulally&#8217;s trip to Toyota, Wall Street analysts had been growing more cautiously optimistic.   >Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy raised his rating on Ford stock to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;sell,&#8221; citing the company&#8217;s cash position of $48.3 billion, up from $23.6 billion at the end of September.   >Steinmetz of Morgan Stanley also raised his rating on Ford to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;equal-weight.&#8221;   >&#8220;While this is not a one-man story, new leadership is a part of our call,&#8221; Steinmetz said in a note for clients.   >Ford&#8217;s revised &#8220;Way Forward&#8221; restructuring, announced in mid-September, disappointed investors and touched off a sharp sell-off of its shares by steering clear of asset sales and failing to address the company&#8217;s liquidity position. But Ford&#8217;s current cash position has eased some of those concerns.   >Brett Hoselton, analyst with Keybanc Securities, forecasts that the rapid deterioration of earnings in 2006 should end in 2007 as Ford generates more than $4 billion in savings -- most of it in 2007 -- from employee departures.   >Everyone agrees, however, that Ford is still in a precarious situation and 2007 is going to be a tough year.   >Ford&#8217;s overall U.S. sales, unadjusted for the number of selling days, slipped 13 percent in December and 8 percent for 2006, partly because of lower demand for its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks.   >The company&#8217;s stock fell 2.72 percent in 2006 and is down 50 percent since early 2005, when its most recent downturn began.   >Ford lost $7 billion through September of last year with further losses forecast in the October-December period quarter and beyond. By Ford&#8217;s own estimate, its North American unit will lose money until 2009 and run through $17 billion cash in the next three years.   >The key risk, according to most analysts, is Ford&#8217;s weak product pipeline at a time when rivals are pushing ahead.   >&#8220;If you look out through 2009, they don&#8217;t have any new small-car products coming out,&#8221; said AMR Research analyst Kevin Reale. &#8220;Most of the products are basically refacing of SUVs and small trucks.&#8221;   >Ford launched its new Edge crossover SUV in December and is gearing up for the arrival of three revamped vehicles in 2007 -- the SuperDuty pickup truck, Focus sedan and Escape SUV. The company also has a larger crossover vehicle in the pipeline that will be based on its Fairlane concept car.   >Ford is aiming to hold its overall share of the U.S. light-vehicle market at 14 percent or more from over 17 percent as it restructures by shutting 16 plants and cutting more than 50,000 jobs.   >&#8220;If the company loses 4 more points of U.S. market share instead of the 2.5 points we are expecting, the turnaround is much tougher, perhaps impossible,&#8221; Steinmetz said.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>For other stories in the series, go to here;src=cms | shows, downturn, their

AGK.AX said it has approached Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG.AX) about a potential A$13 billion ($10 billion) tie-up to create the country&#8217;s biggest gas and electricity supplier.   >AGL said on Thursday that the merger was based on a &#8220;nil premium scrip&#8221; basis, which meant neither company would pay a premium to gain control of the combined entity.   >The news sent AGL&#8217;s shares up over 4.6 percent to A$16.57 by 0129 GMT. But Origin, whose shares have risen over 10 percent in the past month as takeover speculation grew, fell as much as 3.5 percent on disappointment that there would be no higher offer.   >Analysts said a merger of the two companies would create significant cost savings and scale benefits, but stringent requirements laid down by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) could scuttle the deal.   >&#8220;They could try to satisfy the ACCC by selling off some of their business in some states but they would have to divest a significant amount of assets and one would have to ask how they are going to achieve the synergies with these sizeable divestments,&#8221; said Paul Johnston, an analyst at Commsec Ltd.   >A combined entity would have a 49 percent market share of retail customers on Australia&#8217;s east coast, with a significant overlap in Victoria state, where AGL and Origin would control more than two-thirds of the market.   >Analysts said other factors that could also break the deal included whether AGL&#8217;s chief Paul Anthony or his Origin counterpart Grant King, would head the new group.   >Origin confirmed the merger approach, which it said was unsolicited and that it was still evaluating the proposal. The Melbourne-based company added that the proposal was only indicative and preliminary, and that it was not at present in any talks with AGL.   >&#8220;Essentially what they are trying to say is AGL could launch a hostile bid, if they want to. There is no conversation between parties. That means they are still long way off before it (the deal) happens,&#8221; said Albert Hung, chief investment officer with Alleron Investment Management.   >The plan maintains the pace of merger and acquisition activity in Australia, which jumped to a record US$171 billion in announced deals in 2006, according to Thomson Financial, aided by a surge in private equity takeovers.   >The Australian power sector has seen a flurry of takeover activity in the past year as companies compete to grow their infrastructure portfolios in the increasingly competitive market and as the Victorian state government embarks on a privatization policy for its energy assets.   >A combined AGL-Origin group would have more than 6 million customers, a controlling interest in New Zealand&#8217;s largest power generator and retailer Contact Energy (CEN.NZ), and a collection of power plants and oil and gas fields across Australia.   >AGL&#8217;s Managing Director Paul Anthony said in a statement that AGL has for some months assessed the benefits of combining the two entities, adding there was a &#8220;compelling case&#8221; to merge due to the complementary business profiles of each company.   >Combining the two businesses would unlock significant economic and financial benefits, including advancing the monetization of Origin&#8217;s gas reserves, reducing AGL&#8217;s need to acquire gas reserves and allow for a significant reduction in duplicated operating costs.   >In October last year, AGL sold A$6 billion worth of its infrastructure assets to Alinta AAN.AX, while maintaining its retailing and generating assets, in exchange for one-third of Alinta&#8217;s Western Australian retail and co-generation business.   >The Australian Stock Exchange queried Origin last month about its rising share price after media reports that the company could face a bid.   >Origin said then it was not aware of any information that had not been announced which, if known, could explain trading in its shares.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>$1=1.26 Australian Dollar | premium, to, over

(0291.HK), intends to pay 2.5 billion yuan (US$320 million) for Blue Sword, which owns part of 14 breweries sprinkled across Sichuan province and all of a brewery in Guizhou.   > The firm, the current market leader, intends to complete the acquisition of those assets -- which collectively posted a 40 percent jump in unaudited net profit to US$12.4 million in 2005 -- in 2007&#8217;s first quarter, China Resources and SABMiller said in statements on Thursday.   > &#8220;This acquisition further demonstrates CR Snow&#8217;s commitment to invest in prominent local brands which not only complements our national branding strategy but strengthens our leading positions throughout regional markets,&#8221; said Andre Parker, managing director of SABMiller Africa and Asia.   > Blue Sword&#8217;s 14 breweries in Sichuan can produce about 14 million hectolitres annually and the company is expanding to add some 1.6 million hectolitres of capacity, SABMiller said.   > (For a full statement, please click here)   > SABMiller expects its Chinese beer Snow to become the group&#8217;s biggest brand in 2006 and one of the world&#8217;s top four beers, but executives concede that expanding profits will take time because a 640 ml bottle can sell for as little as the equivalent of 12 U.S. cents.   > CR Snow now accounts for nearly a fifth of SABMiller&#8217;s global beer volumes but less than 5 percent of profits.   > That venture vies with local leader Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd. (600600.SS) (0168.HK) and ahead of foreign rivals Anheuser-Busch (BUD.N) and InBev INTB.BR, in a market that is growing at up to 10 percent annually.   > Analysts estimate Snow volumes could have hit 26-27 million hectolitres for 2006, ahead of Miller Lite, which had volumes of 22 million in 2005, and probably behind only Budweiser, Brazil&#8217;s Skol and Mexican beer Corona in global rankings.   > Much of SABMiller&#8217;s growth in China have come from takeovers engineered alongside partner China Resources: last year, the pair bought breweries in northern China&#8217;s Shanxi province and Inner Mongolia, among others.   > Their venture commands about 14.9 percent of China&#8217;s market, exceeding Tsingtao&#8217;s 13.9 percent share at the end of June 2006.   > China Resources shares leapt 10 percent on Wednesday to HK$24.70 ahead of the announcement, outperforming the market&#8217;s 0.51 percent rally to a life&#8217;s high.

They cannot vote on policy but can voice opinions and request delays in voting if they feel it necessary.   > On fiscal policy, Ota said the government might be able to bring forward its key fiscal reform target from the current self-imposed deadline of fiscal 2011/12 due to rising tax revenues.   > But she said the priority should be put on pursuing spending cuts, adding that it was &#8220;disappointing&#8221; to see growing calls among politicians that the government can restore fiscal health without raising the consumption tax rate from the current 5 percent.   > Japan has vowed to balance its public budget outside debt issuance and servicing by fiscal 2011/12, and has said it will begin full-fledged debate this year on whether to raise the consumption tax rate as part of steps to achieve this goal.   > The budget gap that needs to be filled by fiscal 2011/12 was initially estimated at 16.5 trillion yen ($138.3 billion), but was revised down to 9.5 trillion yen last month after taking into account rising tax revenues and the effect of spending cuts.      | which, key, consumption

(HD.N) Chairman and  Chief Executive Robert Nardelli abruptly left the company after  a year of heavy criticism of everything from his pay package to  the underperforming retailer&#8217;s corporate governance.   > Nardelli, 58, will walk away with a severance package of  about $210 million under terms of his employment. He and the  company said in a release that his leaving was a &#8220;mutual  decision,&#8221; and Home Depot shares rose more than 2 percent.   > Succeeding Nardelli is Frank Blake, the 57-year-old vice  chairman who joined Atlanta-based Home Depot in 2002. The moves  of Nardelli and Blake, both former General Electric Co. (GE.N)  executives, took effect on Tuesday, the retailer said.   > Wall Street cheered the leadership change. Many analysts  said that although Nardelli improved operations at the world&#8217;s  largest home improvement retailer, recent unfavorable publicity  dented confidence in Home Depot as it faces a slowing housing  market and competition from rival Lowe&#8217;s Cos. (LOW.N)   > &#8220;I just think it&#8217;s a sign that just from a morale  standpoint and a confidence standpoint ... from investors, from  employees, from the market, they needed to make a change,&#8221; said  Jon Fisher, a portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset  Management, which owns Home Depot shares.    > Many analysts said Blake, who played a key role in Home  Depot&#8217;s expansion into Mexico and a recent purchase in China,  was a better consensus builder, but added his lack of retail  experience was a drawback as store sales weaken.   > Blake &#8220;has never run a company or one of Home Depot&#8217;s major  operating businesses,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler  said in a research note.   > Home Depot also named Joe DeAngelo, head of its growing  supply division geared to contractors, to the new post of chief  operating officer and gave added duties to finance chief Carol  Tome.   > The company said its board was confident about the current  business model and long-term strategy, which includes a push to  expand sales to contractor markets.   > Home Depot also said it waived the retirement age of 72 for  directors John Clendenin, Claudio Gonzalez and Milledge A. Hart  III and asked them to stand for re-election at the 2007 annual  meeting.    > Nardelli, one of the three executives in the running to  succeed GE chief Jack Welch years ago, came to Home Depot in  late 2000 with much fanfare, but drew mixed reviews from  workers and some on Wall Street who expressed concern over his  lack of retailing experience.   > In recent years, Nardelli drew fire from critics who  charged his pay was out of line with company performance. Home  Depot&#8217;s stock has fallen more than 8 percent since Nardelli  arrived, but he has earned at least $119 million in salary and  bonus during that time.   > Late last year, after headlines over Nardelli&#8217;s pay, the  board&#8217;s no-show at the May annual meeting, a federal probe into  company stock-option grant practices and weakening sales and  earnings, activist Home Depot investors became more emboldened,  and takeover rumors sprouted.   > &#8220;You always had the feeling you were very unwelcome&#8221; at  annual meetings run by Nardelli, said corporate gadfly Evelyn  Y. Davis, who owns stock in Home Depot and many other  companies.   > Ralph Whitworth, founder and principal at San Diego-based  Relational Investors, said in mid-December that he was  accumulating Home Depot stock and planned to nominate at least  two directors for election at the retailer&#8217;s 2007 annual  meeting.   > Relational previously led a proxy battle at Sovereign  Bancorp Inc.

The survey found that 25 percent of baby boomers still get paid by their employers with paper checks, compared to only 13 percent for those aged 61 or older.   > And only 18 percent of older baby boomers aged 51-60 said they were likely to enroll in direct deposit in the next year, compared to 30 percent of baby boomers overall. The older boomers also were less likely to bank online, with 36 percent using such facilities compared to 56 percent for those aged 42-50.   > While recent indicators show the national savings rate is declining, the poll showed that only 16 percent of baby boomers say all or most of their future retirement income will come from Social Security. In comparison, twice as many (31 percent) of existing retirees say Social Security makes up all or most of their income.   > The poll also found boomers more likely to wait to collect their Social Security retirement benefits.   > About 16 percent of boomers who are not yet retired plan to start collecting Social Security at age 62, according to the poll, compared with 34 percent of current retirees who started collecting benefits at that age.     | likely, baby, checks

They are doing pretty well on their own. They are on their way to becoming the world&#8217;s largest automaker next year (2007),&#8221; said IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle.   >&#8220;But a joint venture might work. There are some real possibilities there.&#8221;   >Even before Mulally&#8217;s trip to Toyota, Wall Street analysts had been growing more cautiously optimistic.   >Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy raised his rating on Ford stock to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;sell,&#8221; citing the company&#8217;s cash position of $48.3 billion, up from $23.6 billion at the end of September.   >Steinmetz of Morgan Stanley also raised his rating on Ford to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;equal-weight.&#8221;   >&#8220;While this is not a one-man story, new leadership is a part of our call,&#8221; Steinmetz said in a note for clients.   >Ford&#8217;s revised &#8220;Way Forward&#8221; restructuring, announced in mid-September, disappointed investors and touched off a sharp sell-off of its shares by steering clear of asset sales and failing to address the company&#8217;s liquidity position. But Ford&#8217;s current cash position has eased some of those concerns.   >Brett Hoselton, analyst with Keybanc Securities, forecasts that the rapid deterioration of earnings in 2006 should end in 2007 as Ford generates more than $4 billion in savings -- most of it in 2007 -- from employee departures.   >Everyone agrees, however, that Ford is still in a precarious situation and 2007 is going to be a tough year.   >Ford&#8217;s overall U.S. sales, unadjusted for the number of selling days, slipped 13 percent in December and 8 percent for 2006, partly because of lower demand for its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks.   >The company&#8217;s stock fell 2.72 percent in 2006 and is down 50 percent since early 2005, when its most recent downturn began.   >Ford lost $7 billion through September of last year with further losses forecast in the October-December period quarter and beyond. By Ford&#8217;s own estimate, its North American unit will lose money until 2009 and run through $17 billion cash in the next three years.   >The key risk, according to most analysts, is Ford&#8217;s weak product pipeline at a time when rivals are pushing ahead.   >&#8220;If you look out through 2009, they don&#8217;t have any new small-car products coming out,&#8221; said AMR Research analyst Kevin Reale. &#8220;Most of the products are basically refacing of SUVs and small trucks.&#8221;   >Ford launched its new Edge crossover SUV in December and is gearing up for the arrival of three revamped vehicles in 2007 -- the SuperDuty pickup truck, Focus sedan and Escape SUV. The company also has a larger crossover vehicle in the pipeline that will be based on its Fairlane concept car.   >Ford is aiming to hold its overall share of the U.S. light-vehicle market at 14 percent or more from over 17 percent as it restructures by shutting 16 plants and cutting more than 50,000 jobs.   >&#8220;If the company loses 4 more points of U.S. market share instead of the 2.5 points we are expecting, the turnaround is much tougher, perhaps impossible,&#8221; Steinmetz said.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>For other stories in the series, go to here;src=cms | also, sales,, painful

Sainsbury (SBRY.L), Waitrose, Wal-Mart&#8217;s Asda (WMT.N), Marks and Spencer (MKS.L) and McCain.   > Tesco (TSCO.L), Britain&#8217;s biggest retailer that has led the calls for GDA food labeling, has 4,000 products already under the plan and will be marking up thousands more.   > &#8220;All moves to improve labeling have to applauded.

John Spratt of South Carolina, the incoming chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Democrats might decide to waive new budget rules so that Congress can keep upper middle-class taxpayers from getting caught by a tax originally intended for the wealthy.   >Under the new budget rules called &#8220;paygo,&#8221; spending increases or tax cuts would have to be paid for with savings elsewhere in the budget or tax code. But that could make it harder for Democrats to keep their promise to eliminate deficits in five years while providing tax relief for the middle class.   >Over the next several years, an estimated 20 million to 30 million middle-class taxpayers whose incomes rise with inflation could be forced to pay the alternative minimum tax, even though it was intended to prevent the very wealthy from using exemptions to avoid paying taxes.   >Congress has approved a series of temporary fixes for the tax that was first enacted in 1969, but put off any permanent resolution because of its huge impact on the budget. Democrats say a more permanent fix for the AMT would cost the Treasury about $641 billion over 10 years.   >Spratt said that under rules the new Democratic House majority plans to pass on Friday, there will be no exemptions to paygo. But he added, &#8220;That&#8217;s not to say that you couldn&#8217;t come back later in a budget resolution and have some sort of a dispensation from the rule for a certain-sized tax cut.&#8221;   >Republicans, including President George W. Bush&#8217;s budget chief, Rob Portman, oppose the paygo rule, saying it will only encourage Congress to pass tax increases to reduce deficits.   >&#8220;It&#8217;s a plan to raise taxes, plain and simple,&#8221; said Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and senior Budget Committee member.   >Instead, Republicans say the government collects enough tax revenue and they want deficit cuts to be achieved by paring domestic spending. But over the past several years, while they controlled both houses of Congress, domestic spending rose significantly.   >For fiscal 2006, which ended on September 30, the budget deficit was $247.7 billion. | providing, upper, series

But some Western powers want an early session, an IAEA diplomat said.   >Developing nations on the board oppose this as they would see it as a Western gambit to apply restrictive interpretations to the resolution&#8217;s references to technical aid, a precedent they fear would damage their own nuclear-energy aspirations.   >The U.N. Security Council voted on December 23 to ban transfers to Iran of nuclear materials or know-how of possible use in uranium enrichment, fuel-reprocessing or heavy-water reactors. Each process can yield energy for electricity or explosives.   >The resolution also prohibits IAEA technical aid related to enrichment, fuel-reprocessing or heavy-water activity, while exempting projects that are for &#8220;food, agricultural, medical, safety or other humanitarian purposes&#8221;.   >IAEA diplomats said the agency was not providing technical aid in the banned sectors to Iran or any other member state -- reflecting its covenant to both foster peaceful atomic power and deter diversions to bombmaking through regular inspections.   >But in a December 27 letter to board members, IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei said the Council had &#8220;decided to restrict the scope&#8221; of nuclear technical aid to Iran and the board would need to &#8220;consider the relevant obligations&#8221; for the agency.   >Pending the IAEA Secretariat&#8217;s evaluation, ElBaradei said he would ensure that existing technical aid would be &#8220;limited to activities authorized&#8221; by the Security Council.   >Of the 20-odd items of technical aid Iran has received since 1997, most involve work in radiopharmaceuticals, radioactive waste management, radioisotopes for medical care, nuclear power planning, and nuclear safety regulations.   >But at least one project dating to 2001, on the &#8220;feasibility of upgrading a research reactor&#8221;, could well be killed off by the sanctions resolution, one senior IAEA diplomat said.   >A European Union diplomat said up to 11 of the projects could be in jeopardy as they could be associated with fuel production targeted by the Security Council, &#8220;but we will see what the agency (secretariat) has to say&#8221;.   >At the last regular board meeting in November, Iran&#8217;s bid for IAEA safety expertise for a heavy-water reactor was put on indefinite hold after days of haggling between developing and Western states, who originally wanted more projects slashed too.   >&#8220;The catch now, under sanctions, is how do we interpret the technical aid projects designated as &#8216;humanitarian&#8217;? Those who want to put the squeeze on Iran can find ways to do that,&#8221; said an ambassador for a major developing nation on the IAEA board.   >&#8220;But ElBaradei has things under control. So a special board will only raise temperatures, not cool them down which we need so at the end of the day we get a return to negotiations on a diplomatic solution (on Iran),&#8221; he said.   >Iran, the world&#8217;s No. 4 oil exporter, says it wants nuclear fuel only for power plants, not for bombs as the United States and EU allies -- who sponsored sanctions -- suspect.   >But Iran bred mistrust abroad by hiding atomic research from the IAEA for 18 years, failing to satisfy agency investigators since that its goals are wholly peaceful, and ignoring a Security Council demand in July to halt enrichment work. | the, would, U.N.

Bush a set of alternatives as he considers a broad new policy for the deteriorating situation in Iraq.   >A quick, short-term troop increase, or &#8220;surge,&#8221; is just one of many policy changes under consideration. But it is the one that has garnered the most attention in Washington, as American military casualties in Iraq have climbed above 3,000 and analysts question whether a troop increase can stem violence.   >Surge options developed by military planners have ranged widely and could include as many as 10,000 to 30,000 additional troops, according to defense officials speaking on condition of anonymity. The United States now has 132,000 troops in Iraq.   >The plans also differ in how quickly more troops could be deployed, officials said.   >Under one plan, the Pentagon could most quickly increase troop levels by 7,000 to 8,000 by moving in two Army brigades -- one now headed to Kuwait to serve as a standby force and another that has not been announced.   >The Pentagon also could boost troop levels quickly in Baghdad by delaying the anticipated departure of two Marine Corps units now in violent Anbar province, defense officials have said. That option could provide an additional 13,000 to 15,000 troops to Iraq&#8217;s capital.   >Other plans, including those aimed at providing 20,000 or more troops, could take longer to implement, until as late as April, some officials said.   >Some generals, including Gen. John Abizaid, the U.S. Middle East commander due to retire early this year, have raised concerns about the concept of a surge, saying it would heighten opposition to the American presence.   >Some critics have said the plan helps Bush satisfy political interests rather than military goals.   >That is because the mission, defense officials say, is to train Iraqi forces to help them take responsibility for security. Repeatedly, commanders on the ground have said they do not need more troops to accomplish that mission.   >Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who has not disclosed what options he prefers, also said commanders were worried that additional forces would allow Iraqis to ease away from taking security responsibility.   >White House spokesman Tony Snow said Bush is &#8220;fairly far along&#8221; in deciding how to proceed on Iraq but has not completed his new plan.   >Bush is expected to unveil a new Iraq policy as early as next week.   >&#8220;If he goes forward with the idea presumably it means he thinks it will have a positive effect,&#8221; said incoming House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat.   >&#8220;But of course the president has been almost uniformly wrong on what his premise is, of what his actions in Iraq were going to result in, whether it is cost or success, stabilization, support, sectarian violence,&#8221; Hoyer said. &#8220;You name it, their observations have been wrong.&#8221;    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Steve Holland and Susan Cornwell | early, to, as

Patients taking the highest doses of the drug had a 37 times greater risk.   >The study showed patients taking cabergoline were 4.9 times more likely to develop heart valve damage. At higher doses patients were 50.3 times more likely to suffer damage.   >Both drugs are available in generic form.   >A second study, conducted in Italy, tested 245 people, of whom 155 had Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Of the diseased population, one group received pergolide, one group received cabergoline and one group received an alternative Parkinson&#8217;s treatment. The non-diseased control group received nothing.   >The results showed that 23.4 percent of patients taking pergolide and 28.6 percent of patients taking cabergoline suffered heart damage, compared with just 5.6 percent in the control group.   >&#8220;These are huge risks,&#8221; said Roth.   >He added they were similar to the kind of damage seen with fen-phen, whose main ingredients were withdrawn in 1997 and forced the drug-maker Wyeth to take more than $21 billion in charges to cover liabilities.   >Wyeth&#8217;s recalled drugs were fenfluramine, or Pondimin, and dexfenfluramine, or Redux. To make fen-phen, one or the other was combined with another drug called phentermine that is still sold by other companies.   >Wyeth, then called American Home Products, recalled Pondimin and Redux after some of the 6 million Americans who had taken fen-phen developed heart-valve problems.   >Roth said pergolide is also used to treat restless leg syndrome, a condition in which patients feel a crawling sensation in their legs combined with a need to move them.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York | move, one, or

Stocks reversed gains and ended little changed on the day, and the dollar also pared gains but was up on the day.   > &#8220;The biggest change is that they are showing a little more anxiety about the economy,&#8221; said Sam Rahman, a portfolio manager for Baring Asset Management Inc., in Boston.   > &#8220;While inflation remains a key focus, the FOMC is showing clearer signs that the weakening economic environment has raised concerns,&#8221; he said.   > The U.S. central bank at the Dec 12 meeting held benchmark interest rates steady at 5.25 percent, renewing a warning on inflation but also nodding to &#8220;mixed&#8221; economic signals and a &#8220;substantial&#8221; housing slowdown.   > The minutes showed one member of the policy-setting committee was concerned enough about growth to favor a statement saying monetary policy could be adjusted in either direction.   > The statement the Fed issued last month said only that additional firming -- increases in interest rates -- might be necessary to address risks from inflation.   > Participants in the Federal Open Market Committee meeting said the slowdown in the housing sector continued to weigh heavily on economic activity in the United States. Although there was evidence that home sales might be stabilizing, residential investment was likely to fall further in coming quarters as builders reduced inventories, officials felt.   > The housing slowdown has not spilled over significantly into consumer spending, but &#8220;considerable uncertainty&#8221; surrounding housing activity meant its impact on spending could eventually become more evident, especially if house prices decline significantly, officials said.   > At the same time, central bank officials said a slowdown in business investment and production, along with high inventories for automobiles and in other sectors, added to a picture of slowing economic expansion.   > However, economic data released since then has pointed to resilience in the economy.   > Consumer confidence was at its highest level in December in eight months, existing homes sales rose in November for the second month in a row, and Chicago purchasing managers snapped back into expansion mode in the last month of the year, reports released at the end of December showed.   > All of the participants in the meeting remained concerned about inflation, the minutes said.   > &#8220;Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation,&#8221; the minutes said.   > The FOMC saw &#8220;considerable uncertainty&#8221; regarding how much and how fast core inflation would recede and believed that the risks around the desired downward path remained to the upside.          | Market, reports, slowing

Without a declaration of parentage or some other order, the surviving partner would be unable to make decisions for their minor child.&#8221;   >The two women, who have been together since 1990, told the court they did not want to adopt the child because it meant the father would lose his status as a parent.   >&#8220;It&#8217;s an important precedent because the legislature has not kept the legislation up to date,&#8221; said Peter Jervis, one of the lawyers for the applicant, referred to only as &#8220;A.A.&#8221;   >&#8220;The court has basically said that it would step in to recognize this woman as the mother of her child ... and would treat her equally,&#8221; said Jervis.   >He added that the court found the family to be a very loving one and that A.A. had met all the criteria of being a loving mother.   >&#8220;She read the bedtime stories, put the Band-Aids on his fingers, cleaned his runny nose, had taken him off to school,&#8221; said Jervis.   >The Alliance for Marriage and Family, a coalition of several groups that promote a traditional family structure, had filed as an intervenor in the case.   >&#8220;We think there are many good reasons for continuing to uphold the definition of family as two parents,&#8221; said Joanne McGarry, executive director of the Catholic Civil Rights League, one of the groups represented by the alliance.   >&#8220;Once you remove it from the realm of nature and the realm of traditional moral and religious teachings, who&#8217;s going to decide how many parents a child can have? What&#8217;s so magical about three, maybe there could be more.&#8221;   >McGarry said the Alliance had not decided if it would appeal the decision.   >The Institute for Canadian Values, which opposes a 2005 law allowing same-sex marriage in Canada, dismissed the ruling as an act of &#8220;naked judicial activism&#8221;.   >&#8220;The court saw this case as an opportunity to entrench so-called alternative family structures in law without submitting the idea to the rigors of the legislative process,&#8221; Executive Director Joseph Ben-Ami said in a statement.   >However, Laurel Rothman, Director of Social Reform at the Family Services Association of Toronto, which worked with the applicant&#8217;s legal counsel during the case, applauded the decision.   >&#8220;The situation basically recognizes the changing face of families in Canada in the beginning of the twenty-first century,&#8221; said Rothman.   >&#8220;The law is catching up to the reality of families in modern-day Ontario.&#8221;   >Same-sex marriage has been legal in Ontario since 2003, and across Canada since 2005.   >The latest judgment overturned a 2003 ruling by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in which the judge found that he did not have jurisdiction to declare the woman a mother. | a, read, Services

Bush had not seen the Saddam video, Major General William Caldwell urged the Iraqi government to reach out to disillusioned Sunni Arabs, who have warned that the execution and film are blows to the Shi&#8216;ite-led government&#8217;s efforts at national reconciliation.   >Caldwell said U.S. forces, who had physical custody of Saddam for three years, left all security measures at Saddam&#8217;s hanging, including access to the execution chamber, to Iraqis.   >&#8220;Had we been physically in charge at that point we would have done things differently,&#8221; Caldwell told a news conference.   >&#8220;At this point the government of Iraq has the opportunity to take advantage of what has occurred and really reach out now in an attempt to bring more people back into the political process and bring the Sunnis back,&#8221; he said, singling out a need to ease restrictions on former members of Saddam&#8217;s Baath party.   >&#8220;It&#8217;s a real critical juncture.&#8221;   >In unusually direct advice from the U.S. military to Iraqi leaders, Caldwell said the country&#8217;s government and parliament &#8220;will have to rise above past divisions&#8221;.   >&#8220;This will entail difficult decisions ... and hard compromises necessary for national reconciliation.&#8221;   >Caldwell said there had been a lull in violence over the Eid al-Adha holiday which started on Saturday, but U.S. forces were braced for a possible violent backlash still to come.   >Thousands of Saddam&#8217;s fellow Sunni Arabs have marched to vent anger at the execution in Sunni Arab strongholds. More mourners came to visit his grave in his home village of Awja on Wednesday, and other towns also saw further demonstrations.   >A man lights incense sticks during a ceremony in Samara, north of Baghdad, marking the execution of Iraq\'s former President Saddam Hussein, January 3, 2007. REUTERS/Nuhad Hussin >The unofficial video of the hanging, apparently filmed on a mobile phone, showed Shi&#8216;ite officials mocking Saddam just before he was hanged, inflaming sectarian passions in a country already on the brink of sectarian civil war.   >Rubaie blamed the video on people trying to raise tension.   >&#8220;Whoever leaked this video meant to harm national reconciliation and drive a wedge between Shi&#8216;ites and Sunnis,&#8221; said Rubaie, one of some 20 official witnesses at the hanging.   >Sadiq al-Rikabi, an adviser to the prime minister, told Iraqiya state television that a number of guards at the facility had been taken in for questioning and investigators had identified a person suspected of filming the hanging.   >Prosecutor Munkith al-Faroon, heard appealing for order on the video, told Reuters on Tuesday that two senior officials had filmed the hanging, challenging government claims guards did it.   ath d=M16.2928932,1 L12.5,1 C12.2238576,1 12,0.776142375 12,0.5 C12,0.223857625 12.2238576,0 12.5,0 L17.5,0 C17.7761424,0 18,0.223857625 18,0.5 L18,5.5 C18,5.77614237 17.7761424,6 17.5,6 C17.2238576,6 17,5.77614237 17,5.5 L17,1.70710678 L12.8535534,5.85355339 C12.6582912,6.04881554 12.3417088,6.04881554 12.1464466,5.85355339 C11.9511845,5.65829124 11.9511845,5.34170876 12.1464466,5.14644661 L16.2928932,1 Z M1,16.2928932 L5.14644661,12.1464466 C5.34170876,11.9511845 5.65829124,11.9511845 5.85355339,12.1464466 C6.04881554,12.3417088 6.04881554,12.6582912 5.85355339,12.8535534 L1.70710678,17 L5.5,17 C5.77614237,17 6,17.2238576 6,17.5 C6,17.7761424 5.77614237,18 5.5,18 L0.5,18 C0.223857625,18 0,17.7761424 0,17.5 L0,12.5 C0,12.2238576 0.223857625,12 0.5,12 C0.776142375,12 1,12.2238576 1,12.5 L1,16.2928932 Z/>\n                            \n                          \n                        \n                      \n                      Slideshow (2 Images)\n                    \n                    TIMING  \n                    The timing of the execution, just four days after an appeal failed and on the first day of Eid, shocked many, both in Iraq and in the rest of the Muslim world.   >A senior U.S. official told the New York Times Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was concerned that if Saddam was not hanged quickly he would somehow escape the noose.   >&#8220;His concern was security, and that ... maybe there would be a mass kidnapping to bargain for Saddam Hussein&#8217;s release,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He was concerned that he might somehow get free.&#8221;   >Rubaie confirmed that Iraqi officials had been concerned Saddam might escape justice: &#8221;The question is not &#8216;Why the rush in the execution?&#8217; The question is &#8216;Why the delay?&#8217;   >&#8220;Some people were talking about the Americans, saying they might take him to one of these islands controlled by the United States and exile him there.&#8221;   >Rubaie, Faroon and Sami al-Askari, a senior aide to Maliki, all said the date had not been set for the hanging of Barzan al -Tikriti, Saddam&#8217;s half brother and former intelligence chief, and Awad al-Bander, a former chief judge, despite other officials telling media they would hang on Thursday at dawn.   >U.N. rights chief Arbour called for clemency.   >&#8220;International law, as it currently stands, only allows the imposition of the death penalty as an exceptional measure within rigorous legal constraints,&#8221; she said.   >At the United Nations in New York, a spokeswoman for U.N.

The U.S. current account shortfall ballooned to an estimated $869 billion in 2006, from about $472 billion in 2002, according to NY Fed estimates.   > The NY Fed study also indicated that most petrodollar investments found their way into the United States indirectly, as countries like Japan, which had received investments from oil exporters, funneled such inflows back to the United States through the purchase of U.S. securities.   > On the trade side, oil exporters purchased more goods and services from the euro zone and China, which offset both regions&#8217; crude oil imports, the study said.   > The euro zone&#8217;s oil imports more than doubled between 2002-2006, rising roughly by $192 billion to $316 billion, but the region&#8217;s exports to oil-producing nations climbed $77 billion to hit $167 billion. All told, the NY Fed analysts said 41 U.S. cents of each $1 of oil imports came back to the euro zone in the form of higher purchases of euro zone goods.   >  Euro zone exports to oil-producing countries were higher because of geographic proximity, the analysts said. Europe is closer than the United States to the major oil exporters of the Middle East, and two large oil exporters -- Norway and Russia -- are in Europe itself.   > In the case of China, 60 cents of each $1 in oil purchases sent overseas returned to purchase Chinese goods.   > &#8220;This high figure accords with the explosive growth of China&#8217;s exports to all markets. ... Given China&#8217;s gains in market share, the country might well have seen its sales to oil exporters climb sharply, even if oil exporters&#8217; purchases worldwide had remained flat in recent years,&#8221; the NY Fed analysts said.   > By contrast, just 20 cents of each $1 imported by the United States came back for the purchase of American goods.      | billion, that, said.

The Getty museum is the richest U.S. art institution, with an endowment of over $5 billion, and one of the world&#8217;s leading repositories of antiquities.   >Current Getty director Michael Brand has said the museum was willing to return 26 of 46 disputed pieces that Italy wants back, including the Aphrodite, pending a final check on its provenance.   >According to the Times, signs the Aphrodite statue was looted included fractures, dirt smudges that suggested smuggling and the dealer&#8217;s assertion the piece came from a Swiss collector whose family had it since 1939 -- the same year it became illegal to export Italian antiquities.   >&#8220;Any museum professional looking at an archeological piece in those conditions had to suspect it came from an illicit origin,&#8221; said Luis Monreal, former director of the Getty Conservation Institute.   >Monreal said he had warned John Walsh, at the time the museum&#8217;s director, not to buy the statue and even suggested a test of pollen in the dirt would indicate the statue&#8217;s origin.

(LLY.N) and sold under the brand name Permax, and cabergoline, developed by Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) and sold under the brand Dostinex, had a sharply higher risk of heart valve damage than those taking other therapies, the studies said.   > The studies, one of which analyzed the records of 11,417 patients in Britain and one of which tested 245 patients in Italy, reinforce the results of earlier, smaller studies showing that drugs which activate a cellular receptor known as 5-HT2b can cause damage to the heart valve, a serious condition that can lead to heart failure and sudden death.   > &#8220;We recommend that physicians not prescribe drugs that have this biochemical property,&#8221; said Bryan Roth, a researcher at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who was not involved in the trials but viewed the data and commented on it in The New England Journal of Medicine, where both studies appeared.   > Such drugs also include the migraine headache drug ergotamine and the amphetamine derivative known as &#8220;ecstasy.&#8221;   > Roth said his team, in a separate piece of research that has yet to be published or reviewed by the scientific community, has identified several other big-selling drugs that have until now not been known to activate the 5-HT2b receptor.   > He declined to reveal the names of the drugs until the research has been published.   > &#8220;We recommend that every drug be screened at this receptor before it goes into humans,&#8221; Roth told Reuters in an interview. &#8220;It costs just pennies per drug for such a screen.&#8221;   > The British study showed that patients taking pergolide were 7.1 times more likely to develop heart valve damage than those who took other treatments. Patients taking the highest doses of the drug had a 37 times greater risk.   > The study showed that patients taking cabergoline were 4.9 times more likely to develop heart valve damage. At higher doses patients were 50.3 times more likely to suffer damage.   > Both drugs are available in generic form.   > A second study, conducted in Italy, tested 245 people, of whom 155 had Parkinson&#8217;s disease. Of the diseased population, one group received pergolide, one group received cabergoline, and one group received an alternative Parkinson&#8217;s treatment. The non-diseased control group received nothing.   > The results showed that 23.4 percent of patients taking pergolide and 28.6 percent of patients taking cabergoline suffered heart damage, compared to just 5.6 percent in the control group.   > &#8220;These are huge risks,&#8221; said Roth. He said they were similar to the kind of damage seen with fen-phen, whose main ingredients were withdrawn in 1997 and forced the drug-maker Wyeth WYE.N to take more than $21 billion in charges to cover liabilities.   > Wyeth&#8217;s recalled drugs were fenfluramine, or Pondimin, and dexfenfluramine, or Redux. To make fen-phen, one or the other was combined with another drug called phentermine that is still sold by other companies.   > Wyeth, then called American Home Products, recalled Pondimin and Redux after some of the 6 million Americans who had taken fen-phen developed heart-valve problems.   > Roth said pergolide is also used to treat restless leg syndrome, a condition in which patients feel a crawling sensation in their legs combined with a need to move them.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York\n\n\n | showed, in, and

His 6,000-volume library, the largest in North America at the time, became the basis for the Library of Congress.   >Ellison, elected in November, initially came under attack in the blogosphere and by at least one conservative radio commentator after he said he would use the Koran in his unofficial ceremony.   >Members are sworn in to the U.S. House of Representatives as a group with no Bibles or other books involved; but in a country where three out of every four people consider themselves Christians, the Bible has traditionally been used in ensuing unofficial ceremonies.   >These unofficial events among other things provide each member with a photo opportunity for themselves and their constituents.   >Rep. Virgil Goode, a Virginia Republican who represents the area where Jefferson lived, was one of those who criticized Ellison for wanting to use the Koran, calling for strict immigration policies specially crafted to keep Muslims out of the United States.   >The English translation of the Koran from Jefferson&#8217;s collection dates to the 1750s. Jefferson sold his collection to the U.S. Congress after its library was lost when the British burned the Capitol during the War of 1812.

But Boris said no mark-ups were seen for Chantix and Exubera, recently introduced drugs to help smokers quit and to treat diabetes.   > &#8220;We would have guessed that Pfizer would raise list prices a bit less given anticipated political pricing scrutiny in 2007,&#8221; said Merrill Lynch analyst David Risinger, who estimated Pfizer had raised its U.S. average wholesale prices by 5.6 percent.   > Pfizer may have needed to raise prices sharply to make good on its prediction that 2007 revenue will match that seen last year, Risinger said in his research note. The company&#8217;s once-stellar sales growth has come to a halt largely due to generic competition for a number of its products.   > Pfizer spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said the company, which estimates prices on a different basis called wholesaler acquisition costs, had raised prices by 4.7 percent, after taking into consideration discounts Pfizer offers to some customers on the same drugs.   > &#8220;This is (only) one component of our revenue performance,&#8221; he said, referring to the price increases.     | would, consideration, Pfizer

(VZ.N), they will narrow.   > The cost to insure Alltel&#8217;s debt with credit default swaps has doubled since early December on LBO speculation to around 100 basis points on Wednesday, or $100,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt.   > &#8220;The debt is going to be very volatile,&#8221; said Zhiping Zhao, senior analyst at research company CreditSights.   > If Alltel is bought in a leveraged buyout, its ratings would go into junk territory and its spreads will widen by another 100 basis points or more, Zhao said.   > If the company if bought by Verizon, however, its swaps could trade in the 20 basis point area, she added.   > The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that private-equity firms are exploring the idea of a leveraged buyout for the fifth-largest U.S. wireless operator, resulting in a 25 basis point spread widening from 75 basis points.   > An Alltel spokesman said the company does not &#8220;comment on speculation.&#8221;   > Spreads had also widened ahead of the report as speculation increased the company may be a LBO target, said Dave Novosel, analyst at New York-based Gimme Credit.   > &#8220;If you look at the good cash flow they generate, solid margins, very low leverage compared to many other telecom operators: that in of itself tends to be a good candidate&#8221; for an LBO, he said.   > Smaller telecommunications companies are under pressure to consolidate to cut costs and compete against larger firms.   > &#8220;If you are a wireless player you need network coverage and quality,&#8221; said CreditSights Zhao. Wireline operators, meanwhile, need to reduce costs &#8220;given that revenue is flat at best,&#8221; she added.   > &#8220;The only way you can actually maintain your earnings per share, or margin is to reduce costs,&#8221; she said.   > Alltel is subscale and needs to do something to increase its size, Zhao said. The company is probably more attractive to private equity buyers than to Verizon, which is the most likely strategic buyer, she added.   > Due to Alltel&#8217;s low leverage, the buyer of the company has a lot of potential to significantly increase its leverage and extract a lot of value from the firm, she said.   > From Verizon&#8217;s perspective, however, other competitors such as Qwest Corp. Q.N may be more attractive as it would offer greater synergies and cost reduction possibilities, Zhao said.   > Barclays Capital analysts have assigned a 70 percent probability that Alltel may be sold to a private equity buyer if it is sold, compared with a 30 percent probability of a strategic buyer.   > &#8220;While we believe management&#8217;s first preference might be to merge with a strategic buyer, the relative lack of strategic buyers versus the economics of an LBO may make the latter too compelling to ignore,&#8221; the analysts wrote in a research report on Wednesday.     | basis, be, your

While there have been cycles of warming and cooling throughout Earth&#8217;s history, the last 30 years have seen a steep warming trend which most scientists say is due to emission of so-called greenhouse gases by the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, factories and power plants.   > ExxonMobil has funded legitimate scientific studies on climate change, the watchdog report said, but noted it has also spent approximately $16 million between 1998 and 2005 on 43 organizations that have cast doubt on the reality of human-caused global warming.   > The report said these have ranged from $30,000 for the group Africa Fighting Malaria, which argues on its Web site against urgent action on climate change, to $1.6 million to the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business think tank in Washington.   > James McCarthy, professor of biological oceanography and director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, noted a 2005 statement issued by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and 10 science academies from other countries, affirming that &#8220;climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action.&#8221;   > &#8220;This report reveals for the first time the degree to which efforts to exaggerate uncertainty in climate science produce non scientific reports designed to cast doubt on published scientific climate studies have been orchestrated by ExxonMobil,&#8221; McCarthy said at the news conference.   > Company spokesman Dave Gardner said in an e-mail that the company acknowledged the burning of fossil fuels is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.   > He said ExxonMobil supports various public policy groups but said financial support does not mean it has control over the groups&#8217; positions.   > &#8220;We find some of them persuasive and enlightening, and some not.

Mitt Romney, a former venture capitalist credited with turning around the scandal-hit Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002, took the first steps on Wednesday toward a 2008 White House bid.   >Romney, 59, said he had filed papers with the Federal Election Commission in Washington to establish a presidential exploratory committee and fund-raising apparatus. A Romney aide said afterward that the paperwork was not due at the FEC until later on Wednesday.   >&#8220;I have a feeling we are going to be pretty busy,&#8221; Romney told reporters outside his office in Massachusetts. &#8220;We have filed exploratory papers today. So the process is moving forward on that front.&#8221;   >A devout Mormon and former bishop in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Romney -- the son of former Michigan Gov. George Romney -- has several advantages, political analysts say.   >He is a polished communicator with an actor&#8217;s good looks. He gained national attention for rescuing the 2002 Olympics and earned degrees from both Harvard business and law schools before going on to make millions in business.   >But as a one-term governor from a state with a liberal reputation, Romney still has hurdles to overcome among conservative Republicans, who are a major force in the party&#8217;s nominating process. He has no foreign policy experience and has made conflicting statements on some social issues.   >&#8220;One of his stiffest obstacles is his continuing support for the war in Iraq. He&#8217;s been unwavering in his belief that President Bush is following the right path,&#8221; said Jeffrey Berry, a professor at Tufts University.   >Romney has cast himself as a social conservative to the right of both Arizona Sen. John McCain and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, two of the early Republican favorites.   >He has courted Republican donors, met with prominent evangelical leaders, huddled with lobbyists in Washington and recently hired advertising specialist Alex Castellanos, who worked on President George W. Bush&#8217;s 2000 campaign.   >Some conservatives, however, are bothered by his inconsistent record on social issues such as gay rights and abortion, which he said in 1994 should stay &#8220;safe and legal&#8221; before more recently declaring himself &#8220;firmly pro-life.&#8221;   >In a failed 1994 bid to unseat Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney told a prominent gay rights group he would be better in fighting discrimination against gays and lesbians than his rival, and he endorsed federal gay rights legislation. As governor, his stance changed and his policies tilted further to the right.   >&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to visualize the TV commercials that will be used against him. His opponents in Republican primaries will make sure that every voter in each state will know that he has reversed course on critical social issues,&#8221; said Berry.   >He also must overcome skepticism over what some Republicans call the &#8220;Mormon thing.&#8221; Mormon leaders have spent decades countering critics who dismiss the faith as a cult and a threat to Christianity.   >The once-isolated sect based in Salt Lake City, Utah, is one of the world&#8217;s fastest growing and most affluent religions, with 12.3 million members globally. But its past could haunt a Romney presidential campaign, including its now-severed links to polygamy and a former ban on blacks from leadership roles.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Kevin McNicholas | nominating, Arizona, following

His last major appearance on the public stage, at an Asian foreign ministers&#8217; gathering in Kuala Lumpur in July 2006, saw him being wheeled around on a golf cart.   >Paek rebuffed calls to hold a joint meeting there with other foreign ministers to discuss the North&#8217;s nuclear plans. Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear test three months later, on October 9.   >&#8220;Leader Kim Jong-il Wednesday sent a wreath to the bier of the late Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun, deputy to the DPRK (North Korea) Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly, expressing deep condolences over his death,&#8221; the official KCNA news agency said. It gave no further details.   >Analysts said at the time the choice of Paek to head Pyongyang&#8217;s foreign service was surprising because he was better known as a cadre familiar with South Korea than as a career diplomat.   >North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun sits in a car before leaving the parliament house in Kuala Lumpur July 27, 2006.

He declined to provide details about the U.S. forces.   >The Islamists, who deserted their last stronghold on Monday after two weeks of war against Somali government troops backed by Ethiopia, have pledged to fight on after melting into the hills between the Indian Ocean port of Kismayu and Kenya.   >McCormack did not name specific extremists, but U.S. officials said before the war the top layer of the Somalia Islamic Courts Council (SICC) was controlled by a cell of al Qaeda operatives. The head of the council, Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys, is on U.N. and U.S. extremist lists.   >During the six-month rule of the Islamists, U.S. officials tried with no success to persuade the SICC to give up three suspects wanted for the 1998 bomb attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania who Washington believed were in Somalia.   >Somali Prime Minister Ali Mohamed Gedi said on Tuesday that pro-Islamic fighters from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Arab countries were taken prisoner during the fighting.   >&#8220;FAILED STATE&#8221; STATUS   >The United States set up the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa in 2002 in Djibouti, where a former French Foreign Legion base serves as a major hub for U.S. counter-terrorism training and operations as well as humanitarian efforts.   >Members of that 1,800-member task force have also trained with troops in Ethiopia, and U.S. ships patrol the nearby Gulf of Aden, according to Pentagon documents.   >Asked about the widely shared assumption that Ethiopia&#8217;s two-week campaign to oust Somalia&#8217;s Islamists enjoyed U.S. blessing, McCormack said Washington had preferred a negotiated settlement.   >&#8220;But it became apparent over time, and certainly very apparent in the recent weeks, that that wasn&#8217;t going to happen and that the Islamic courts were intent upon trying to seize control over all of Somalia through use of arms,&#8221; he said.   >&#8220;There were real concerns about the composition of the leadership of those Islamic courts,&#8221; McCormack added.   >The State Department would announce plans later on Wednesday to send humanitarian aid to Somalia, he said.   >Jendayi Frazer, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, would co-host a meeting on Friday in Kenya aimed at finding ways to help Mogadishu and &#8220;to move Somalia out of the category of a failed state,&#8221; the spokesman said.   >Frazer was in the Ethiopian capital for meetings with the leaders of Ethiopia and Uganda.

Security Council last month, is the way to go, Russian U.N.

Moscow is building an $800 million light-water nuclear reactor for Iran at Bushehr.   >The restrictions on Iran&#8217;s trade in sensitive nuclear materials and technology, imposed by the 15-nation Security Council in a December 23 resolution, were intended to pressure Iran to halt sensitive nuclear activities and resume talks aimed at curbing its nuclear ambitions.   >Iran says it wants only to produce nuclear power, but the West says Tehran is using a civilian energy program as a cover for developing nuclear weapons.   >After the council approved the sanctions, UnderSecretary of State Nicholas Burns said Washington would press Russia, China, Japan and the European Union to take more vigorous action as individual governments, including cutting off lending to Iran.   >&#8220;We don&#8217;t think this resolution is enough in itself.

Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Nardelli has abruptly left the company after a year of heavy criticism of everything from his pay package to the underperforming retailer&#8217;s corporate governance.   >Nardelli, 58, will walk away with a severance package of about $210 million. He and the company said in a release that his leaving was a &#8220;mutual decision,&#8221; and Home Depot shares rose more than 2 percent.   >Succeeding Nardelli is Frank Blake, the 57-year-old vice chairman who joined Home Depot in 2002. The moves of Nardelli and Blake, who are both former executives of General Electric Co., took effect on Tuesday, according to the company.   >Wall Street largely cheered the leadership change. Many analysts said that although Nardelli improved operations at the world&#8217;s largest home improvement retailer, recent unfavorable publicity dented confidence in Home Depot as it faces a slowing housing market and competition from rival Lowe&#8217;s Cos.   >&#8220;I just think it&#8217;s a sign that just from a morale standpoint and a confidence standpoint ... from investors, from employees, from the market, they needed to make a change,&#8221; said Jon Fisher, a portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management, which owns Home Depot shares.   >Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank, who now owns the National Football League&#8217;s Atlanta Falcons team, said in a statement that &#8220;with change comes opportunity, and I&#8216;m hopeful the company will continue to grow and thrive&#8221; under new leadership.   >Many analysts said Blake, who worked at the U.S. Energy Department before joining Home Depot, was a better consensus builder, but they said his lack of retail experience was a drawback as store sales weaken.   >Blake &#8220;has never run a company or one of Home Depot&#8217;s major operating businesses,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said in a research note.   >In November, Home Depot reported a 3 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, its first quarterly report of profit decline since the fourth quarter of 2002. It also sharply pared its forecast of earnings growth for the year as sales at stores open at least a year fell 5.1 percent.   >Home Depot also named Joe DeAngelo, head of its growing supply division geared to contractors, to the new post of chief operating officer and gave added duties to finance chief Carol Tome.   >In its statement, Home Depot said the board expressed confidence in the company&#8217;s current business model, long-term strategy and future growth potential.   >But &#8220;potential disruption at Home Depot could provide Lowe&#8217;s with a unique opportunity to gain market share,&#8221; Citigroup said in a research note.   >Nardelli, one of the three executives in the running to succeed GE chief Jack Welch years ago, came to Home Depot in late 2000 with much fanfare, but drew mixed reviews from some on Wall Street who expressed concern over his lack of retailing experience.   >After negative headlines over Nardelli&#8217;s pay, the board&#8217;s no-show at the 2006 annual meeting in May, a federal probe into company stock-option grant practices and weakening sales and earnings, activist Home Depot investors became more emboldened, and takeover rumors sprouted.   >&#8220;You always had the feeling you were very unwelcome&#8221; at annual meetings under Nardelli&#8217;s tenure, said corporate gadfly Evelyn Y. Davis, who owns stock in Home Depot and many other companies. &#8220;Maybe the best solution would be a merger or acquisition,&#8221; she told Reuters.   >Ralph Whitworth, founder and principal at San Diego-based Relational Investors, said in December that he was accumulating Home Depot stock and planned to nominate at least two directors for election at the retailer&#8217;s 2007 annual meeting.   >&#8220;They need some fresh blood on this board,&#8221; Whitworth said in an interview on Wednesday on the CNBC network. &#8220;We are going to push on.&#8221;   >Relational previously led a proxy battle at Sovereign Bancorp Inc. and eventually took a seat on that company&#8217;s board.   >Longtime shareholder Laborers&#8217; International Union of North America called on Home Depot to require investor approval of &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; benefits for officers, calling Nardelli&#8217;s $210 million severance package &#8220;obscene.&#8221;   >Last month, Home Depot said it found almost 20 years of options backdating, resulting in $200 million in unrecorded expenses. The retailer&#8217;s independent review of the options practices concluded that there was no intentional wrongdoing by any current member of the management team or board.   >Home Depot shares, which were up 93 cents, or 2.3 percent, at $41.09 in afternoon trading, have risen about 4 percent since early June and have rallied recently on speculation the company could be a target for a private equity buyout.   >Home Depot said Nardelli and Blake were not available to comment.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Brad Dorfman, Jessica Wohl and Ben Klayman in Chicago and Patrick Fitzgiboons and Nicole Maestri in New York | &#8220;potential, not, led

While there have been cycles of warming and cooling throughout Earth&#8217;s history, the last 30 years have seen a steep warming trend which most scientists say is due to emission of so-called greenhouse gases by the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, factories and power plants.   >ExxonMobil has funded legitimate scientific studies on climate change, the watchdog report said, but noted it has also spent approximately $16 million between 1998 and 2005 on 43 organizations that have cast doubt on the reality of human-caused global warming.   >The report said these have ranged from $30,000 for the group Africa Fighting Malaria, which argues on its Web site against urgent action on climate change, to $1.6 million to the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-business think tank in Washington.   >James McCarthy, professor of biological oceanography and director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University, noted a 2005 statement issued by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and 10 science academies from other countries, affirming that &#8220;climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action.&#8221;   >&#8220;This report reveals for the first time the degree to which efforts to exaggerate uncertainty in climate science produce non scientific reports designed to cast doubt on published scientific climate studies have been orchestrated by ExxonMobil,&#8221; McCarthy said at the news conference. | change, on, quest

It angered Saddam&#8217;s fellow Sunni Arabs and sparked international condemnation.   >The controversy over the execution video erupted as Bush is preparing to unveil a new strategy on Iraq that could come as early as Tuesday.   >&#8220;I think the most important thing to realize is that Saddam Hussein was executed after a long trial, a long and public trial that met international standards,&#8221; White House spokesman Tony Snow said.   >&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting because there seems to be a lot of concern about the last two minutes of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s life and less about the first 69 (years) in which he murdered hundreds of thousands of people, that&#8217;s why he was executed,&#8221; he said.   >Bush had been focused on the judicial process that was followed in Iraq and &#8220;the way forward,&#8221; and had not seen the video, &#8220;because that&#8217;s not his focus,&#8221; another White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, said earlier.   >An Iraqi official said on Wednesday a number of guards had been taken in for questioning and that one person had been identified as a suspect in filming the illicit video.   >The White House said U.S. concerns about the way Saddam&#8217;s execution was carried out were expressed to the Iraqi government through the U.S. Embassy and military officials in Baghdad.   >Bush had been &#8220;briefed fully&#8221; on U.S. Embassy efforts to delay Saddam&#8217;s execution, Snow said. The execution went ahead just four days after Saddam&#8217;s appeal failed and at the start of the Eid religious holiday, over the reservations of the U.S. ambassador who had urged a two-week delay.   >&#8220;The American government made known to the Iraqi government its thoughts on it.

Its stock stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange in November.   > Remaining shareholders will receive C$86 for every share held. The total value of the deal is worth C$19.35 billion.   > Shares of Inco were up 6 Canadian cents at C$85.96 on Wednesday on the TSX on volume of about 80,000 shares by early afternoon.   > At the meeting, where Inco&#8217;s name was displayed by itself for the last time, one shareholder asked former Inco CEO and current CVRD-Inco&#8217;s chief executive, Scott Hand, to translate Companhia Vale do Rio Doce to English from Portuguese. It means: Company of the valley of the sweet river.   > Another investor spoke about how three generations of family members owned Inco stock.   > For Hand, who failed to create a made-in-Canada mining powerhouse by merging Inco with former compatriot Falconbridge, at least the &#8216;Inco&#8217; name will live on.   > &#8220;The new company is called CVRD Inco Limited, so the Inco name continues as a great name and I think that was one of the smart things that CVRD decided in acquiring Inco --  to keep the Inco name,&#8221; Hand told a reporter after the meeting.   > &#8220;We consider marketing to be very important and so does CVRD and I think that lots of places around the world...Inco nickel is seen as something that is pretty good.&#8221;   > Inco was known as the world&#8217;s No. 2 nickel producer and CVRD is set to become the largest producer of the metal when new nickel projects come on stream over the next few years.   > Hand lost Falconbridge to a sweeter offer from Swiss-based Xstrata Plc XTA.L in July 2006. After shopping around for other buyers, Inco agreed to be taken over by CVRD in September.   > CVRD chief executive Roger Agnelli appointed Hand as the head of CVRD Inco, in charge of all nickel operations. Since then, the two companies have been integrating assets and Hand said it is &#8220;going well.&#8221;   > &#8220;I think everything will be completed probably by the end of this month or early in February. Everything is on schedule,&#8221; he said.   > Hand will be with the company until integration is complete. After that, Hand and Agnelli will discuss Hand&#8217;s next role.   > Meanwhile, CVRD and Xstrata have started general talks about combining operations in the Sudbury, Ontario basin, where CVRD Inco and Xstrata Nickel (formerly Falconbridge) have major nickel operations.   > &#8220;You can assume during the new year that (discussions) will proceed,&#8221; said Hand.   > When Inco and Falconbridge were trying to merge, the two companies touted millions of dollars in synergies from combining their operations in Sudbury.   > &#8220;Today it&#8217;s two separate companies talking instead of one.

The shot-gun marriage was arranged last February in the face of unwelcome advances toward Suez by Italy&#8217;s Enel (ENEI.MI), but legal rulings have delayed the consummation until next July.   > After a meeting on Wednesday, the AMF decided that due to a statement by the Pinault family holding company Artemis on Tuesday that it was keeping all its options open regarding a possible bid for Suez, Artemis had to make its intentions clear.   > Unless Artemis makes a statement before next Tuesday that it has no plans for a bid, the AMF&#8217;s ruling council will consult with all parties involved and fix &#8220;a date at which the company Artemis, alone or in concert, needs to register a planned public offer for the shares of Suez or issue a statement that contains the characteristics of a public offer,&#8221; AMF said in a statement.   > Artemis and Suez were not immediately available for comment.   > Earlier on Wednesday, the government reiterated its backing for a merger between Suez and Gaz de France.   > &#8220;The position of the state as a shareholder is as follows: The state supports clearly and strongly the Suez-GDF merger plan,&#8221; government spokesman Jean-Francois Cope told reporters after the weekly meeting of the French government.   > The Suez-GDF merger already hangs in the balance after a recent court decision that it cannot go ahead until the full liberalisation of European Union energy markets on July 1 -- potentially tying its fate to the outcome of April/May presidential elections.   > Suez shares closed down 0.33 percent at 39.77 euros. The stock surged nearly 6 percent in the past two sessions to hit a lifetime high of 40.50 euros. Suez is the world&#8217;s second-largest water group and a major energy company.   > French media reports said Pinault plans to break up Suez if his bid succeeds, selling its energy assets to GDF and its environmental unit to Veolia Environnement (VIE.PA).   > Wendel Investissement (MWDP.PA) and concessions group Vinci (SGEF.PA) could also be interested in buying parts of Suez, according to the reports.   > But doubts remained on Pinault&#8217;s ability to wrap up the financing for a costly acquisition, which some analysts estimated at around 60 billion euros.   > &#8220;If Pinault goes to see banks saying he has a commitment from GDF to buy Suez&#8217;s energy business for 40 billion euros, and from Veolia to take the environmental unit for 10 billion, he will have no problem raising the cash,&#8221; said a sector analyst, who asked not to be named.   > &#8220;But maybe nothing is agreed yet and this is why Suez is trying to force him (Pinault) into the open,&#8221; the analyst added.   > Pinault may also have problems convincing some shareholders to tender their shares, a banker close to the situation said, pointing in particular to Albert Frere, who owns around 8 percent of Suez&#8217;s capital and 12 percent of the voting rights.   > &#8220;Albert Frere would not say no to a hefty capital gain, but I doubt he will feel like making a present to Pinault,&#8221; the banker said.   > Frere could opt to launch his own breakup bid for Suez, the banker said, a scenario which some analysts believe is possible, given recent delays in the completion of the Suez-GDF merger.   > Officials at Groupe Bruxelles Lambert LAMBt.BR, the financial holding company controlled by Belgium&#8217;s Albert Frere, declined to comment.

Bush said on Wednesday the budget he presents to Congress next month will aim to balance the budget by 2012 and make lower tax rates permanent.   >&#8220;Next month I will submit a five-year budget proposal that will balance the federal budget by 2012,&#8221; Bush said after a meeting at the White House with top administration officials.   >Bush said the budget would address &#8220;priorities&#8221; like &#8220;the need to keep this economy growing by making tax relief permanent.&#8221;   >Balancing the budget in the given timeframe would require substantial spending discipline, given that recent projections by the White House showed it expected a budget gap of $127 billion by 2011.   >Bush also said entitlement programs for retired Americans and for medical care need reform. &#8220;We need to reform Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid so future generations of Americans can benefit from these vital programs without bankrupting our economy,&#8221; Bush said.   >The Bush administration tried unsuccessfully in the past to reform Social Security, proposing to make private savings accounts a part of the retirement program in an effort that was rejected by the public and by Democrats.   >Bush faces a Democrat-controlled Congress after elections last November that cost his Republican party its majorities in the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives, and he suggested both parties could work together to curb wasteful spending.   >&#8220;One important message we all should take from the elections is that people want to end the secretive process by which Washington insiders are able to get billions of dollars directed to projects, many of them pork-barrel projects that have never been reviewed or voted on by the Congress,&#8221; Bush said. | by, Bush, that

2007010302:20 PM EST | 2007010302:20 | FACTBOX-Fed staff forecasts from FOMC minutes | http://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSFED20070103 |  - The following are the Federal Reserve&#8217;s staff forecasts as contained in the minutes released this year of Federal Open Market Committee meetings:   > DEC. 12 FOMC: Minutes released on Jan. 3, 2007   > &#8220;The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that growth in economic activity had slowed to a pace below that of the economy&#8217;s long-run potential in the second half of 2006, partly as a result of the ongoing adjustment of the housing sector. The rate of increase in real GDP was expected to pick up gradually as the drag from the contraction in residential construction diminished, returning towards the end of 2007 to a rate close to the staff&#8217;s estimate of potential output growth. Core inflation was anticipated to edge down in 2007 and 2008 in response to a waning of the effects of higher energy and import prices, a step-down in rent increases, and the emergence of a small amount of slack in the economy.&#8221;   > OCT. 24-25 FOMC: Minutes released on Nov. 15   > &#8220;The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that growth of real GDP had slowed further in the third quarter, reflecting both a significant drag from the continuing contraction in residential construction and a steep decline in motor vehicle assemblies. Looking ahead, a gradual reduction in the restraining effects of the contraction in residential investment and further solid gains in consumer and business spending were expected to lead to a pickup in GDP growth through 2007 and into 2008. These gains in spending were likely to be supported by past declines in energy prices and continued gains in payroll employment and labor income. Real GDP was expected to rise at a somewhat slower rate over the next two years than in 2006 in part as a result of less impetus from household wealth, interest rates, and fiscal policy. The projected increase in real output over the next year or so was a little below the staff&#8217;s estimate of potential output growth, leading to a lessening in pressures on resource utilization. Core inflation was anticipated to edge down in 2007 and 2008 relative to the second half of this year because of the diminishing impetus from the prices of energy and other commodities and because of the modest easing in resource utilization.&#8221;   > SEPT. 20 FOMC: Minutes released on Oct. 11   > &#8220;The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that real GDP growth would continue to slow into the second half of 2006 before strengthening gradually thereafter. By 2008, output was projected to be expanding at a pace about equal to the staff&#8217;s forecast of potential output growth. The staff, however, had again reduced its projection for potential GDP growth, and the projected slow pace of growth over the next several quarters was thus consistent with an opening of only a small gap in resource utilization. In the near term, the cooling of the housing market and lower motor vehicle production were expected to hold growth back. At the same time, though, significantly lower energy prices, sustained increases in labor income, and favorable labor market conditions were anticipated to support expansion through the end of the year. Further ahead, the lagged effects of the previous tightening of monetary policy and waning stimulus from household wealth and fiscal policy were anticipated to restrain growth, but the drag from the downturn in residential construction was expected to abate. Core consumer price inflation was projected to drop back somewhat later this year and next, reflecting the emergence of slack in the economy and lower energy costs.&#8221;   > AUG. 8 FOMC; Minutes released on Aug. 29   > &#8220;The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that real GDP growth would slow in the second half of 2006 and 2007, and to a lower rate than had been anticipated in the prior forecast. The marking down of the outlook was largely attributable to the annual revision of the national income and product accounts, which involved downward revisions to actual GDP growth in prior years and prompted reductions in the staff&#8217;s estimate of potential output. The slowdown in the housing market, the effects of higher energy prices on household purchasing power, the waning impetus of household wealth effects on consumer spending, and the effects of past policy tightening were expected to hold economic growth below potential over the next six quarters. Core consumer price inflation was projected to drop back somewhat later this year and next, mainly as the effects of higher energy and import prices abated.&#8221;   > JUNE 28-29 FOMC; Minutes released on July 20   > &#8220;The staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that, after the significant deceleration of real GDP in the current quarter from the first quarter of 2006, growth would proceed through the end of 2007 at a pace a bit below the rate of growth of the economy&#8217;s potential. The outlook for modest growth of real GDP reflected a slowdown in the housing market, the effects of past policy tightening, and a diminished boost to consumer spending from increases in household wealth. Core consumer price inflation was projected to have stepped up in the second quarter from its average pace over the preceding several quarters but to then drop back somewhat, albeit to a level higher than previously forecasted, as energy and import prices flatten out and some slack emerges in labor and product markets.&#8221;   > MAY 10 FOMC; Minutes released on May 31   > &#8220;The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real GDP growth moderating somewhat from the average pace of the previous several quarters. The projected deceleration of real GDP reflected the lagged effects of the tightening of monetary policy, the waning impetus from increases in household wealth, and reduced stimulus from fiscal policy. While higher energy prices were expected to boost inflation in the near term, structural productivity was strong, and the influence of higher energy and material costs was thought likely to moderate. Thus, consumer prices, after increasing at a faster rate in the first half of the year, were expected to decelerate later this year and next year.&#8221;   > MARCH 27-28 FOMC; Minutes released on April 18   > &#8220;The staff forecast prepared for this meeting showed real GDP expanding briskly in the current quarter. Economic growth was expected to moderate later this year. The level of output in the current quarter was estimated to be close to the economy&#8217;s potential and was anticipated to remain so over the projection period. Core PCE inflation was expected to move slightly higher in 2006 because of cost pressures induced by high energy and import prices and to step back down in 2007 as these cost pressures were anticipated to abate.&#8221;   > JAN. 31 FOMC; Minutes released on Feb. 21   > &#8220;The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, after slow growth in the fourth quarter of 2005, real GDP would expand at a fairly robust pace over the first half of this year, boosted in part by spending on recovery activities associated with the hurricanes. Thereafter, real GDP growth was expected to moderate, importantly reflecting a reduced impetus to consumption from house price appreciation and some slowing in residential housing expenditures. Core PCE inflation was expected to be a touch higher this year than in 2005, largely because of the pass-through of higher energy and nonfuel import prices, but, with energy prices leveling out, core inflation was projected to drop back modestly in 2007.&#8221;   | GDP, from, a
2007010302:18 PM EST | 2007010302:18 | INSTANT VIEW 2-U.S. Fed's FOMC minutes from December 12 | http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSN0351064320070103 |  - U.S. Federal Reserve officials agreed at their December meeting inflation was the predominant concern, but some felt the &#8220;subdued tone&#8221; of economic data meant risks to growth had increased, minutes released on Wednesday from the December 12 meeting show.   >The U.S. central bank at that meeting held benchmark interest rates steady at 5.25 percent, renewing a warning on inflation but also nodding to &#8220;mixed&#8221; economic signals and a &#8220;substantial&#8221; housing slowdown.    > CARY LEAHEY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK:   >&#8221;I see more headlines that are bearish for bonds than are bullish, but the market could be higher because it already lost so much ground in December and there weren&#8217;t any surprises in the headlines of the FOMC minutes at all.   >&#8221;One bullish item for Treasuries was that several members of the Fed monetary policy committee saw a &#8216;subdued tone&#8217; to the economic data and thought the downside risk to growth had increased. But this Fed meeting was held before the spate of reports, starting with retail sales in the middle of December, that showed the economy looking more resilient. So the one headline that could be viewed as bullish for bonds is probably, correctly, considered by the market to be out of date.   >&#8220;Another item that could be seen as bullish for bonds is the fact that one FOMC member said the policymakers should open up the possibility of rates going in either direction, implying a chance of an ease.&#8221;   > SAM RAHMAN, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BARING ASSET MANAGEMENT INC.,   >&#8221;The biggest change is the they are showing a little more anxiety about the economy. Inflation was a key focus, while they seemed to think the economy was chugging along just fine. Now, while inflation remains a key focus, the FOMC is showing clearer signs that the weakening economic environment has raised concerns.   > MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BANK OF NEW YORK,   >&#8220;I don&#8217;t find anything in the minutes that changes my view for either the economy or the dollar. Generally speaking, the minutes helped refine our understanding of where the Fed is in terms of policy. The Fed right now still believes there&#8217;s upside risk to inflation, so there&#8217;s a greater risk of a rate hike in the first quarter of the year than a rate cut. That should be supportive for the dollar at the margin. They indicate the data was on balance a bit weaker than expected, but wasn&#8217;t weak enough to change the assessment of the economy and policy.&#8221;   > LARA RHAME, SENIOR FX STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK:   >&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything really surprising here. I think people are taking tentative profits on their dollar gains so far today because the minutes are very much &#8221;permanent hold&#8220; kind of minutes and I think they reflect an FOMC that was discussing a somewhat more downbeat economy on December 12, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re looking at today. So I think for that reason, certainly I would not have thought that they would have been dollar-positive.&#8221;   > MARKET REACTION: - U.S. Treasury debt prices edge up after December Fed meeting minutes say downside risk to growth had increased.  - Dollar slips vs euro after Dec FOMC minutes say downside risk to growth has increased.

2007010302:08 PM EST | 2007010302:08 | UPDATE 1-Canada's slowing economy set to crimp jobs growth | http://www.reuters.com/article/companyNewsAndPR/idUSN0341821920070103 |  - Canada&#8217;s robust labor market will likely show signs of weakness in December, reflecting a sharper-than-expected slowdown in economic growth, analysts said on Wednesday.   > The economy added more jobs than expected in both November and October despite the slowdown. But the average forecast in a Reuters poll is that a modest 10,000 jobs were created in December with the unemployment rate unchanged at 6.3 percent.   > The data are due at 7 a.m. (1100 GMT) on Friday.   > The recent strong headline jobs numbers have masked underlying weaknesses. Jobs have been plentiful in resource-rich western Canada while lay-offs have been the norm in the powerful central provinces of Ontario and Quebec where the U.S. slowdown has taken a toll on exporters.   > Also, all the job growth in November came from part-time jobs while full-time positions were lost.   > &#8220;I think the risk is certainly toward a pretty weak number,&#8221; said Marc Levesque, chief fixed-income strategist at TD Securities.   > &#8220;The data on GDP growth for the past two months has been surprisingly weak and suggests the Canadian economy in the fourth quarter will probably have difficulty even eking out positive growth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d be surprised to see Canada&#8217;s job market continue to pump out jobs at that pace.&#8221;   > In the United States, private sector employment likely declined by 40,000 in December, suggesting an abrupt slowing of employment there, the monthly ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday.   > Max Clarke, economist at IDEAglobal, sees downside risks to the research firm&#8217;s estimate of 20,000 new jobs in December, because the data are so volatile.   > &#8220;You could even see a number that&#8217;s single digit,&#8221; Clarke said.   > Whatever the jobs report reveals, the Bank of Canada is unlikely to be rattled. Bank Governor David Dodge has already acknowledged that fourth-quarter 2006 growth appears to be weaker than the bank had anticipated.   > The central bank has kept its key overnight rate steady at 4.25 percent since May 2006 following seven straight hikes, saying the risks to its economic outlook are balanced.   > Markets rule out any interest rate moves on Jan. 16, the bank&#8217;s next policy announcement date, but are keen to see if policymakers will change their neutral tone to reveal a bias toward rate cuts later this year, as is widely expected.   > &#8220;Whether or not (the jobs report) will cause them to revise their risks is going to depend on whatever data we get for the U.S. and Canada from this point on,&#8221; said Levesque.   > The course of Canadian interest rates may also depend on when the U.S. Federal Reserve starts easing monetary policy, some analysts said.   > The Canadian dollar fell hard versus the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, in part on expectations that the Fed may hold rates steady for longer than many expected.    | recent, jobs, digit,&#8221;

The greenback erased losses spurred by an earlier report showing the first contraction in the U.S. private sector job market since April 2003.   > &#8220;The fact that ISM came back above 50 puts the whole soft-landing, dollar-positive scenario back in play,&#8221; said Boris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist at Forex Capital Markets in New York.   > Led by strong gains against European currencies including sterling, the euro and the Swiss franc, the dollar was set for its biggest rise in around six months against a basket of six major currencies =USD.   > The euro EUR= was trading down 0.9 percent on the day at $1.3156, while sterling tumbled more than 1 percent to $1.9496 GBP=.

They are doing pretty well on their own. They are on their way to becoming the world&#8217;s largest automaker next year (2007),&#8221; said IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle.   >&#8220;But a joint venture might work. There are some real possibilities there.&#8221;   >Even before Mulally&#8217;s trip to Toyota, Wall Street analysts had been growing more cautiously optimistic.   >Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy raised his rating on Ford stock to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;sell,&#8221; citing the company&#8217;s cash position of $48.3 billion, up from $23.6 billion at the end of September.   >Steinmetz of Morgan Stanley also raised his rating on Ford to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;equal-weight.&#8221;   >&#8220;While this is not a one-man story, new leadership is a part of our call,&#8221; Steinmetz said in a note for clients.   >Ford&#8217;s revised &#8220;Way Forward&#8221; restructuring, announced in mid-September, disappointed investors and touched off a sharp sell-off of its shares by steering clear of asset sales and failing to address the company&#8217;s liquidity position. But Ford&#8217;s current cash position has eased some of those concerns.   >Brett Hoselton, analyst with Keybanc Securities, forecasts that the rapid deterioration of earnings in 2006 should end in 2007 as Ford generates more than $4 billion in savings -- most of it in 2007 -- from employee departures.   >Everyone agrees, however, that Ford is still in a precarious situation and 2007 is going to be a tough year.   >Ford&#8217;s overall U.S. sales, unadjusted for the number of selling days, slipped 13 percent in December and 8 percent for 2006, partly because of lower demand for its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks.   >The company&#8217;s stock fell 2.72 percent in 2006 and is down 50 percent since early 2005, when its most recent downturn began.   >Ford lost $7 billion through September of last year with further losses forecast in the October-December period quarter and beyond. By Ford&#8217;s own estimate, its North American unit will lose money until 2009 and run through $17 billion cash in the next three years.   >The key risk, according to most analysts, is Ford&#8217;s weak product pipeline at a time when rivals are pushing ahead.   >&#8220;If you look out through 2009, they don&#8217;t have any new small-car products coming out,&#8221; said AMR Research analyst Kevin Reale. &#8220;Most of the products are basically refacing of SUVs and small trucks.&#8221;   >Ford launched its new Edge crossover SUV in December and is gearing up for the arrival of three revamped vehicles in 2007 -- the SuperDuty pickup truck, Focus sedan and Escape SUV. The company also has a larger crossover vehicle in the pipeline that will be based on its Fairlane concept car.   >Ford is aiming to hold its overall share of the U.S. light-vehicle market at 14 percent or more from over 17 percent as it restructures by shutting 16 plants and cutting more than 50,000 jobs.   >&#8220;If the company loses 4 more points of U.S. market share instead of the 2.5 points we are expecting, the turnaround is much tougher, perhaps impossible,&#8221; Steinmetz said.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>For other stories in the series, go to here;src=cms | Kevin, in, when

The retailer was the subject last year of media and market speculation that it is ripe for a leveraged buyout.   >After media outlets named Kohlberg, Kravis &amp; Roberts and Texas Pacific Group as being interested, Home Depot said in early December that it had not had any discussions about a potential buyout by private equity firms or a recapitalization.   >A few weeks later the company disclosed that a large activist investor firm, Relational Investors, was planning to launch a proxy fight that included the creation of a board committee that would consider strategic alternatives -- such as the sale of the company -- and management performance.   >But analysts, bankers and private equity investors agree there is a major obstacle to a deal: the equity and the debt that a leveraged buyout exceeding $100 billion would require.   >IT&#8216;S JUST TOO BIG   >And analysts said on Wednesday that while Nardelli&#8217;s departure might be sparking yet another round of speculation on a possible sale -- as is often the case when a top executive leaves with little notice -- Home Depot is probably just too big.   >&#8220;There have been a lot of rumors that Home Depot is a private equity play. We would not read that much into that. We just think that it&#8217;s way too large of a fish to swallow,&#8221; said Richard Steinberg, president of Steinberg Global Asset Management in Boca Raton, Florida. His firms owns shares in both Home Depot and rival Lowe&#8217;s Cos. Inc. (LOW.N).   >A $100 billion deal would be far larger than anything yet attempted, and surpass the largest takeout ever -- KKR&#8217;s $25.1 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. in 1988.   >Arun Daniel, a consumer analyst with ING Investments, said that LBO speculation is helping the stock, but is unrealistic.   >&#8220;The LBO scenario, while the math works, from a practical perspective, it&#8217;s difficult because simply the size of the financing. And based on my discussion with major bankers, it&#8217;s very difficult to pull off,&#8221; Daniel said.   >While real estate sales and co-investments by multiple private equity firms could help a Home Depot leveraged buyout, most bankers and private equity investors say that a $40 billion to $50 billion LBO is about all the market can handle right now.   >Indeed, several bankers and private equity investors told Reuters that the market is capable of handling roughly $30 billion of high yield debt and another $10 billion or so of bank debt.   >Since private equity firms rarely, if ever, use more than 10 percent of their funds for a single deal, and there are only a handful of funds with more than $15 billion, it would severely limit the number firms capable of doing the deal.   >Indeed, Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said in a research note that while its numbers show that a leveraged buyout of Home Depot makes sense in terms of returns up until the $46 level, the size of the deal is a barrier because of the limits of the financing markets.   >&#8220;We therefore think an LBO is relatively unlikely,&#8221; Fassler wrote.   >In the U.S. options market, many investors greeted the surprise resignation by accumulating bullish calls as they bet on more upside potential in the shares of the home improvement retailer, according to Jon Najarian, co-founder of optionmonster.com, a Web information site in Chicago.   >&#8220;They are also optimistic about Home Depot&#8217;s board being receptive to merger combinations and/or a leveraged buyout,&#8221; he added.   >Home Depot shares rose 3.3 percent to $41.49 in New York Stock Exchange trading.   >During the first half of the session, roughly 39,500 calls and 9,300 puts traded in Home Depot, above its average daily volume of 39,930 contracts, according to market research firm Track Data.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Michael Flaherty and Nicole Maestri in New York and Doris Frankel and Ben Klayman in Chicago | Executive, for, Exchange

In his book, he recounts how after trying to save a Web page from his Internet browser, he received a message that said it couldn&#8217;t be done and gave him no other recourse but to hit the OK button.   >&#8220;No, it is not OK with me that this operation didn&#8217;t work and the program can&#8217;t explain why,&#8221; he wrote.   >Platt, who has also written nine books for computer professionals, has a message for software developers: &#8220;Your.

Programing instructions required for such features, Platt said, &#8220;increase the possibility of crashing errors and security vulnerabilities in the same way as more moving parts on any mechanical device render it less reliable.&#8221;   >David Thomas, executive director of the Software &amp; Information Industry Association&#8217;s software division, disputed Platt&#8217;s assessment of computer programmers.   >According to Thomas, the trouble with software programs is that good ones often get overloaded with features demanded by &#8220;power users,&#8221; such as big corporations or vocal individuals.   >&#8220;You don&#8217;t want your customers to design your product,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re really bad at it.&#8221;   >As more and more software becomes Internet-based, he said, companies can more easily monitor their users&#8217; experiences and improve their programs with frequent updates.   >They have a financial incentive to do so, since more consumer traffic results in higher subscription or advertising revenues.   >&#8220;They know that if they don&#8217;t make the customer experience enjoyable that the customer will stop using them,&#8221; he said, &#8220;whereas if I sell you a (software) product, I don&#8217;t care if you use it or not; I have your money.&#8221;   >There is one area, however, where Thomas and Platt agree: the Web still has a long way to go.   >Too many Web sites start off with home pages that offer animation, music -- and no real information.   >&#8220;Every time I want to look at an article and I have to click to get past that multimedia thing, it drives me crazy,&#8221; Thomas said. &#8220;They should be monitoring the fact that 99 percent of people try click on &#8216;close&#8217; within a certain fraction of a second to get away from that thing.&#8221;   >Web search company Google Inc. and photocopy chain Fedex Kinko&#8216;s, a unit of Fedex Corp., provide easy-to-use Web sites, but others are still more complicated than they need to be, Platt said.   >Starbucks Corp. incurred his wrath because the coffee shop chain required him to specify a search radius when he was trying to use its site find the nearest store.   >&#8220;The Starbucks programmers probably think that having more control over the search is powerful and cool,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;But in reality it&#8217;s a useless and annoying distraction. Nobody goes around asking, &#8216;Is there a Starbucks within five miles? How about 10? 15?\'&#8221;   >Platt said he voiced his sentiments to Starbucks, but received only an automated response. The company did not comment for this article.   >While companies may not always reply, Platt urges his readers to let them know about software problems by posting feedback on their Web sites. &#8220;The best companies want to hear from users,&#8221; he said.   >He also advises consumers to check out what trustworthy software reviewers have to say about a product before they buy it and to post their own comments on Web sites that sell the programs.   >However, individuals can only do so much, and he is working on forming an organization called It Just Works (suckbusters.com) to laud the good programs and ridicule the bad.   >While Platt believes market forces are moving the software industry in the right direction, he already is thinking about writing a sequel called &#8220;Why Software Still Sucks.&#8221;   >&#8220;I&#8217;d be astounded,&#8221; he said in an e-mail, &#8220;if (the industry) made so much progress in the next year or two that it might not benefit from another nudge.&#8221; | right, I, Not.

They put aside the team from the Interior Ministry that was supposed to carry it out,&#8221; the official said.   >An official execution video, which had no sound and ended before Saddam falls through the trapdoor, boosted Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki&#8217;s authority among his fractious Shi&#8216;ite allies.   >But the mobile phone images have hardened perceptions among Saddam&#8217;s disillusioned fellow Sunnis about triumphant Shi&#8216;ites and dealt a blow to Maliki&#8217;s efforts for reconciliation.   >The U.S. military, which had kept physical custody of Saddam for three years until he was handed to Iraqis minutes before the execution, said on Wednesday it had no role in the hanging but that it would have handled it differently.   >&#8220;Had we been physically in charge at that point we would have done things differently,&#8221; U.S. military spokesman Major General William Caldwell told a news conference in Baghdad.   >Caldwell said U.S. forces left all security measures at Saddam&#8217;s execution, including searching witnesses for mobile phones, to Iraqi authorities. He said U.S. troops immediately left the building where Saddam was executed after handing him over at 5:30 a.m., 25 minutes after he left his U.S. prison on a 10-minute helicopter ride to the execution site.   >&#8220;We had absolutely nothing to do with the facility where the execution took place,&#8221; Caldwell said.   >Rubaie said he handed over his mobile phone before boarding a U.S. helicopter that transported an official delegation of a little more than a dozen people from the Green Zone government compound to the execution.   >Prosecutor Munkith al-Faroon, who also attended the execution and told Reuters he saw two senior government officials film the hanging with their mobiles, said on Wednesday the taunts came from guards who were outside the chamber.   >&#8220;These shouts were spontaneous.

(F.N) is heading into the new year with a highly regarded chief executive, $48 billion in cash, a new crossover utility vehicle expected to prove a hit and the projected savings from the departure of a third of its work force.   >Then there is the bad news: the automaker is mortgaged to the hilt, struggling with the legacy of wobbly product plans and banking on its third turnaround plan in the last five years to deliver sustained profitability.   >With Ford poised to lose its No. 2 spot in the U.S. market to Toyota Motor Corp. (7203.T) in 2007, analysts are weighing the potential payoffs of Ford&#8217;s painful restructuring against the risk posed by its heavy borrowing.   >For now, the pessimism on Wall Street is waning, but analysts caution that it will at least two years before a recovery shows signs of traction.   >&#8220;Ford is a deep turnaround situation,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analyst Jonathan Steinmetz said in a recent note for clients.   >But the building blocks are forming, said Steinmetz, who sees sustainable positive cash flow from Ford&#8217;s auto operations as still four years away.   >A key reason for a turn in Wall Street sentiment is Ford&#8217;s new chief executive, Alan Mulally, a restructuring expert who was lured away from Boeing Co. (BA.N) in September.   >Since Mulally took over from Ford family scion Bill Ford Jr. in October, he has moved to streamline management, appointed a global product chief and raised about $25 billion in cash through liens, bond offerings and credit lines.   >The company has also reached out to Toyota, the increasingly dominant Japanese automaker, which eagerly studied Ford in the 1930s when it was a maker of looms branching out to manufacture cars.   >Analysts say Mulally&#8217;s trip to Tokyo earlier this month to meet Toyota Chairman Fujio Cho might prompt a partnership that would help Ford bring down costs in areas such as parts procurement, technology development and planned plant closures.   >&#8220;You have to ask yourself what would be in it for Toyota. They are doing pretty well on their own. They are on their way to becoming the world&#8217;s largest automaker next year (2007),&#8221; said IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle.   >&#8220;But a joint venture might work. There are some real possibilities there.&#8221;   >Even before Mulally&#8217;s trip to Toyota, Wall Street analysts had been growing more cautiously optimistic.   >Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy raised his rating on Ford stock to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;sell,&#8221; citing the company&#8217;s cash position of $48.3 billion, up from $23.6 billion at the end of September.   >Steinmetz of Morgan Stanley also raised his rating on Ford to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from &#8220;equal-weight.&#8221;   >&#8220;While this is not a one-man story, new leadership is a part of our call,&#8221; Steinmetz said in a note for clients.   >Ford&#8217;s revised &#8220;Way Forward&#8221; restructuring, announced in mid-September, disappointed investors and touched off a sharp sell-off of its shares by steering clear of asset sales and failing to address the company&#8217;s liquidity position. But Ford&#8217;s current cash position has eased some of those concerns.   >Brett Hoselton, analyst with Keybanc Securities, forecasts that the rapid deterioration of earnings in 2006 should end in 2007 as Ford generates more than $4 billion in savings -- most of it in 2007 -- from employee departures.   >Everyone agrees, however, that Ford is still in a precarious situation and 2007 is going to be a tough year.   >Ford&#8217;s overall U.S. sales, unadjusted for the number of selling days, slipped 13 percent in December and 8 percent for 2006, partly because of lower demand for its best-selling F-Series pickup trucks.   >The company&#8217;s stock fell 2.72 percent in 2006 and is down 50 percent since early 2005, when its most recent downturn began.   >Ford lost $7 billion through September of last year with further losses forecast in the October-December period quarter and beyond. By Ford&#8217;s own estimate, its North American unit will lose money until 2009 and run through $17 billion cash in the next three years.   >The key risk, according to most analysts, is Ford&#8217;s weak product pipeline at a time when rivals are pushing ahead.   >&#8220;If you look out through 2009, they don&#8217;t have any new small-car products coming out,&#8221; said AMR Research analyst Kevin Reale. &#8220;Most of the products are basically refacing of SUVs and small trucks.&#8221;   >Ford launched its new Edge crossover SUV in December and is gearing up for the arrival of three revamped vehicles in 2007 -- the SuperDuty pickup truck, Focus sedan and Escape SUV. The company also has a larger crossover vehicle in the pipeline that will be based on its Fairlane concept car.   >Ford is aiming to hold its overall share of the U.S. light-vehicle market at 14 percent or more from over 17 percent as it restructures by shutting 16 plants and cutting more than 50,000 jobs.   >&#8220;If the company loses 4 more points of U.S. market share instead of the 2.5 points we are expecting, the turnaround is much tougher, perhaps impossible,&#8221; Steinmetz said.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>For other stories in the series, go to here;src=cms | out,&#8221;, be, a

GT.N rose 9.5 percent on Wednesday after the No. 1 U.S. tire maker projected savings from a new labor contract well above what analysts had expected.   >The shares reached their highest price since May 2002 after the company obtained relief from long-term union retiree health-care obligations and forecast hefty savings from improved productivity.   >The labor pact ended a nearly three-month strike by the United Steelworkers union. With the strike resolved, analysts expect Goodyear to turn toward announced plans to sell assets, such as its engineered products business, and a possible equity offering.   >A Goodyear spokesman declined to comment.   >Union members went on strike at 16 Goodyear facilities in the United States and Canada on October 5. They began returning to work Tuesday after ratifying new contracts last week.   >The projected savings imply increased attrition rates for union workers that may come in part from future buyouts, J.P. Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note to clients.   >Patel, who has an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on Goodyear, also said the company likely would look to close a non-union plant in North America to meet its goal for capacity cuts, and also may trim non-union health-care and pension benefits.   >Deutsche Bank upgraded Goodyear to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;hold&#8221; on Tuesday, mainly due to much-larger-than-expected projected cost savings from the new labor contract. It said this addressed some of its long-term concerns about the tire maker&#8217;s competitiveness.   >Goodyear expects up to $610 million in savings under the three-year contract, and $300 million of annual savings thereafter. The agreement allows Goodyear to hire new workers at lower wage and benefit levels.   >The company agreed to investments in its North American plants but will trim capacity with the closing of a Texas tire plant, putting it closer to its goal for reducing high-cost tire production capacity in North America.   >Shares of Goodyear were up $2 at $22.99 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. | Tire, goal, Patel

Compare that with an 18.78 percent rise on the MSCI all-country world stock index .MSCI.   >At a more detailed level, U.S. Treasuries returned 3.12 percent in dollar terms, British gilts just 0.50 percent in sterling, and Japanese government bonds 0.30 percent in yen. Euro zone bonds lost 0.42 percent for euro holders.   >The Citigroup indexes suggest, however, that unhedged dollar investors had a better time of it. For them, Britain returned 14.57 percent, and the euro zone 11.32 percent.   >The spreads, of course, came courtesy of the weakening dollar, which declined around 8.5 percent against a basket of currencies =USD during the year and more than that against the likes of the euro EUR= and pound GBP=.   >But similar benefits will have accrued to unhedged dollar investors making equity plays overseas, meaning that even those who got the more robust gains from bonds could have done far better on many of the world&#8217;s bourses.   >So what about this year? Investors have entered 2007 clearly expecting more of the same for now.   >Reuters asset allocation polls  showed bond holdings at the end of December were higher than 12 months previously, but below highs of the past two years.   >U.S., continental European and British investors were all underweight in bonds and expecting to stay that way for at least three months. A Merrill Lynch poll showed 65 percent of fund managers were underweight bonds.   >The key for bonds this year likely will be how much the U.S. economy slows and whether this translates into central banks lowering interest rates globally.   >The European Central Bank and central banks of England and Japan are showing no such proclivity whatsoever and are instead leaning toward hikes.   >Prospects for U.S. rates under the Federal Reserve have been different following its pause after a long tightening cycle. But any hopes for near-term easing probably went out the window with Wednesday&#8217;s manufacturing data.   >Futures markets are pricing in roughly 50 basis points of Fed easing this year, which would take the fed funds rate down to 4.75 percent. Only a month ago, however, futures were discounting 75 basis points of rate cuts.   >The Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s manufacturing index for December bounced back to 51.4 from 49.5 in November. Readings above 50 denote expansion in the sector and readings below denote contraction.   >Research by investment bank HSBC economists Ian Morris and Ryan Wang earlier in the week noted that an ISM below 50 usually stays that way for eight or nine months and presages a Fed easing phase.   >HSBC is projecting a sharper-than-expected U.S. slowdown and five Fed rate cuts by the end of the year.   >The rub for bond investors is that even in this rate-cutting scenario, the bank researcher saw already relatively low long-end U.S. bond yields dropping less than half a point from current levels -- hardly a bonanza. | current, investors, be

(WMT.N) is moving workers to a new advanced scheduling system, building on a pilot program it tested last year that schedules hourly employees based on the number of shoppers in a store.   >&#8220;This is exactly what we were piloting before, and it has been introduced to cashiers and customer service positions,&#8221; Wal-Mart spokeswoman Sarah Clark said.   >The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Wal-Mart will start moving many of its 1.3 million workers from predictable shifts to a system based on how many customers are in stores at a given time.   >Wal-Mart said last year that it was testing the system as it looks to cut labor costs. Clark said Wal-Mart plans to move all hourly workers to the new system this year.   >Critics contend the advanced system takes hours away from full-time employees and demands more flexibility from workers.   >&#8220;You are saying to workers who are already getting paid poorly ... if you want any hours, you have to agree to work when we want you to work and to agree to a schedule that changes,&#8221; said Chris Kofinis, spokesman for WakeUpWalMart.com, which has pressured Wal-Mart to improve pay and benefits.   >But Clark said the retailer does not have &#8220;open availability,&#8221; meaning workers are available to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. She said no hours have been cut or reduced as part of the new scheduling system.   >Wal-Mart said the new system ensures that stores are fully staffed at peak shopping times and it takes into account the hours employees prefer to work.   >&#8220;It is much friendlier and more predictable than the previous system in that it actually asks for our associates preferences of when they prefer to work,&#8221; Clark said.   >She said under the old system, store managers drew up schedules based on the level of sales in a store. Now, increased staffing will coincide with times when customer traffic surges, she said.   >Clark said employee schedules are now available three weeks in advance, while under old system, schedules were posted two to three weeks in advance.   >Clark said the size of the pilot program was &#8220;significant,&#8221; but she did not have numbers on how many employees were included in the pilot.   >The Journal report said other retailers such as Payless ShoeSource Inc.

2007010312:30 PM EST | 2007010312:30 | The facts on filing those fall freshman aid forms | http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersEdge/idUSN15253920070103 |  - Parents, pick up your pencils. It&#8217;s time to fill out the financial aid forms that may get you some help with those arrhythmia-inducing tuition bills.   >It&#8217;s a great time to ask for financial aid. Federal and local governments and colleges have been giving out some $135 billion a year, according to the College Board. And Congressional Democrats say they are going to make aid more plentiful and college loans more affordable when they take control of Capitol Hill this week.   >So, get the paperwork in for your fledgling fall freshman. Here&#8217;s how.   >-- First, position yourself.   >Savings in your children&#8217;s name penalizes their aid award far more than savings in 529 plans do. A loophole in the law allows you to clean out your kid&#8217;s account and put the money in a 529 plan. Do that now, before you fill out and sign the aid forms. Some states will give you a tax break for that 529 deposit, even if you pull the money out next year to pay for that first semester.   >Financial aid formulas similarly put your retirement savings off limits but not your regular savings. So make your 2006 IRA contribution before you finish the forms.   >-- Then file fast.   >Though they may claim they don&#8216;t, some schools give more money to early birds. Their financial aid offices start out generously and then, if they perceive themselves running low of funds, get a bit more tight-fisted later in the application cycle.   >You can, and should, file your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) before the end of January, even if you don&#8217;t have exact figures for your 2006 income and tax situation. You can always amend your form. Don&#8217;t wait for the July 31 federal deadline, because states and individual schools have their own deadlines that may be earlier.   >-- Check with all the schools your child applied to and find out whether they require any other forms.   >Many private schools also require the College Board&#8217;s PROFILE form (profileonline.collegeboard.com), and some might have their own forms, as well.   >-- Apply online, as do 90 percent of financial aid applicants.   >Do that at fafsa.ed.gov. The online version of the form is slightly different than the printed version, and allows you to forward the form to more schools. It also collects information about students who might qualify for a new federal grant program for low-income high achievers. The paper form doesn&#8216;t.   >-- Make sure all the schools get your forms.   >This year&#8217;s online FAFSA allows you to list six schools to receive the forms. But you can add additional schools and should, so that every college that got an application from your child also gets financial aid forms.   >-- Try to DIY.   >There are many professionals who are willing to fill out the forms for you for a fee, but it&#8217;s not that hard, says Tom Joyce of student lending firm Sallie Mae.   >His firm offers an informational Web site with instructions and checklists to make it easier at collegeanswer.com. It&#8217;s free to file the FAFSA, so you shouldn&#8217;t fill out the form at a Web site that charges you for filing, he says.   >-- Don&#8217;t limit your child until you see all of the financial aid offers.   >You may think that you make too much to qualify for aid, but you may be wrong. Some private schools with large endowments hand out big money even to well-heeled kids. Fill out the forms, even if you don&#8217;t expect much, and maybe you&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised come April, when aid awards are announced.   >&#8220;The stakes are high and getting higher every year,&#8221; says Joyce. &#8220;Parents and students need to make sure they get the form filled out early and take advantage of all the free money.&#8221; | big, your, form

That prompted investors to scale back already limited expectations for a cut of U.S. benchmark interest rates in the first quarter.   > Ahead of the ISM data, bond prices had climbed after the ADP National Employment Report showed private sector employers shed 40,000 jobs last month. That contrasted sharply with market forecasts for an increase of 128,000 and represented the first contraction in private sector employment in nearly four years.   > &#8220;We are still not getting a consistent story from the numbers and this leads to more questions than answers on where (the economy is) headed next,&#8221; said Mario DeRose, fixed-income strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, Missouri.   > &#8220;The Treasury market seems somewhat confused also and is unsure of which way to go.

Bond yields and prices move inversely.   > The Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s December manufacturing report reading was 51.4, above the 50 mark that divides expansion from contraction; it was above economists&#8217; forecasts for 49.9, and up from November&#8217;s 49.5 reading.   > Earlier data showed that U.S. private sector employment likely declined by 40,000 in December, the first contraction since April 2003, according to the ADP National Employment Report.   > &#8220;Clearly, going into the employment data this Friday, people coming into the New Year with a clean book would certainly feel that this (the ADP report) is something people want to be buying bonds on,&#8221; said Michael Cheah, vice president and portfolio manager with AIG SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City.   > Economists&#8217; median forecast for non-farm payrolls, due on Friday, has been for a rise of 110,000 jobs in the overall economy in December, but after the ADP report some Wall Street analysts pared back their forecasts for payrolls.   > Two-year notes US2YT=RR, which respond closely to expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate moves, traded unchanged in price for a yield of 4.80 percent, compared with 4.80 percent on Tuesday.   > Bond investors were also turning their sights to minutes from the Federal Reserve&#8217;s December policy-setting meeting, due at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT) for clues to how the Fed viewed trends in the economy in early December.   > Thirty-year bonds traded down 3/32 in price for a yield of 4.79 percent US30YT=RR.         | &#8220;Clearly,, non-farm, clean

But the average forecast in a Reuters poll is that a modest 10,000 jobs were created in December with the unemployment rate unchanged at 6.3 percent.   > The strong headline jobs numbers have masked underlying weaknesses. Jobs have been plentiful in resource-rich western Canada while lay-offs have been the norm in the powerful central provinces of Ontario and Quebec where the U.S. slowdown has taken a toll on exporters.   > Also, all the job growth in November came from part-time jobs while full-time positions were lost.   > &#8220;I think the risk is certainly toward a pretty weak number,&#8221; said Marc Levesque, chief fixed-income strategist at TD Securities.   > &#8220;The data on GDP growth for the past two months has been surprisingly weak and suggests the Canadian economy in the fourth quarter will probably have difficulty even eking out positive growth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d be surprised to see Canada&#8217;s job market continue to pump out jobs at that pace.&#8221;   > In the United States, private sector employment likely declined by 40,000 in December, suggesting an abrupt slowing of employment there, the monthly ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday.   > Max Clarke, economist at IDEAglobal, sees downside risks to the research firm&#8217;s estimate of 20,000 new jobs in December, because the data are so volatile.   > &#8220;You could even see a number that&#8217;s single digit,&#8221; Clarke said. &#8220;The one thing that is difficult to measure is the change in part-time jobs or even as we saw recently the changes in full-time jobs. The headline number itself is difficult to gauge when those two numbers are weighted equally.&#8221;   > Whatever the jobs report reveals, the Bank of Canada is unlikely to be rattled.

The greenback erased losses spurred by an earlier report showing the first contraction in the U.S. private sector job market since April 2003.   > &#8220;The fact that ISM came back above 50 puts the whole soft-landing, dollar-positive scenario back in play,&#8221; said Boris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist at Forex Capital Markets in New York.   > Led by strong gains against European currencies including sterling, the euro and the Swiss franc, the dollar was set for its biggest rise in around six months against a basket of six major currencies =USD.   > The euro EUR= was trading down 0.8 percent on the day at $1.3175, while sterling tumbled more than one percent to $1.9485 GBP= in its biggest daily decline since July 2005.

Sengupta, finance director at Indian gas firm Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG.BO).   > The company expects a deal by end-June after negotiations with the project&#8217;s joint venture partners Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N), Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L).   > However, spokesman Michael Barrett said Chevron, who has already pre-sold almost all its Gorgon gas, was not the seller. Barrett said each partner was handling negotiations for sales of its share of Gorgon gas separately.   > Exxon Mobil and Shell declined comment on potential Gorgon gas sales discussions.   > Exxon Mobil has previously been linked with sales to India, while Shell has said it planned to sell all or part of its share of LNG from Gorgon to the North American market, via a terminal in Baja California, Mexico.   > Sengupta&#8217;s comments clarified earlier remarks by Petroleum Secretary M.S. Srinivasan, who told reporters at a conference that the gas was from Australia&#8217;s North West Shelf, which may have been a reference to the region that includes Gorgon, rather than the North West Shelf (NWS) venture LNG project.   > &#8220;Some delays due to environment concerns were there, but that has been sorted out. We expect to sign a deal in the next 60 days,&#8221; Srinivasan said.   > &#8220;It is a 25-year contract and supplies are expected to begin in 2011.&#8221;   > India, which imports more than 70 percent of the fuel it consumes, wants to ensure adequate supplies to sustain an economy growing at more than 8 percent a year. It is also negotiating LNG purchases with Iran.   > Srinivasan said India&#8217;s domestic gas production was seen at 200 million cubic metres a day in the next five years. Petronet says India&#8217;s regasification capacity for LNG -- gas super cooled and shipped by tanker -- stands at 10 million tonnes a year.   > India imposes price controls on domestic gas sales, keeping prices below world market levels. However, the LNG is destined for industrial users such as fertiliser manufacturers and power stations, which will have to pay market rates.   > Gorgon&#8217;s operator Chevron won a government green light last month for the project, which has been beset by worries over its environmental impact that have pushed back first deliveries until after the originally planned date of 2010.   > Chevron holds a 50 percent stake, while Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell Plc each have 25 percent. Chevron has made preliminary agreements to sell LNG to Japanese customers, including Osaka Gas Co. Ltd. (9532.T) and Tokyo Gas Co. (9531.T).   > Gorgon is expected to have a total liquefaction capacity of 10 million tonnes a year. The greater Gorgon area has estimated gas reserves of about 40 trillion cubic feet (tcf), a quarter of Australia&#8217;s known gas reserves.   > Western Australia, rich in natural gas, is home to many major LNG developments, including the North West Shelf gas field operated by Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL.AX).   > NWS currently has a production capacity of 11.6 million tonnes of LNG per year and will increase to 16.3 million from late 2008. Woodside has been working to renew long-term supply agreements with Japanese customers that underpin the project.   > The six equal partners in the NWS joint venture are Woodside, BHP Billiton (BHP.AX)(BLT.L), Chevron, BP Plc (BP.L), Japan Australia LNG (MiMi) Pty.

The index stood at 555.8 in the previous week, which was its lowest level since early August.   >Applications were 5.4 percent above their year-ago level.   >The indexes tend to be volatile on a weekly basis, analysts say. However, the monthly average shows a decline in the volume of applications for home loans, with the four-week moving average of mortgage applications down 2.8 percent.   >Jim Svinth, chief economist at LendingTree.com, an online company that matches consumers with lenders, said the slim difference between the borrowing costs for some fixed- and floating-rate loan types has been luring consumers.   >&#8220;While we expect interest rates to stay relatively flat for the next couple of quarters, it&#8217;s interesting to note that the spread between fixed and adjustable rate mortgages is the tightest it&#8217;s been since December 2000,&#8221; he said.   >&#8220;This represents a real opportunity for borrowers to shift from adjustable to fixed rate loans,&#8221; said Svinth, who is based in Irvine, California.   >Borrowing costs on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, excluding fees, averaged 6.22 percent, up 0.10 percentage point from the previous week.

However, the purchase index was below its year-ago level of 418.3, a drop of 2.7 percent.   >Demand for home refinancing loans also strengthened as the MBA&#8217;s seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications increased 2.2 percent to 1,640.4, up 20.3 percent from a year ago. This followed two consecutive weeks of sharp declines.   >The refinance share of applications decreased to 48.1 percent from 48.8 percent the previous week.   >In the past adjustable-rate mortgages, known as ARMs, have been a refuge for cash-strapped consumers seeking to buy a home with low initial mortgage payments.   >But the ARM share of activity decreased to 20.4 percent from 23.1 percent the previous week, its lowest since July 2003.   >Fixed 15-year mortgage rates averaged 5.93 percent, up from 5.84 percent. Rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) decreased to 5.84 percent from 5.87 percent.   >The MBA&#8217;s report precedes separate data this week gauging the state of the U.S. housing market.   >The National Association of Realtors will release data on pending sales of existing U.S. homes in November on Thursday.   >U.S. housing industry indexes, in general, tend to be volatile and in recent months they have painted a mixed picture, with some pointing to weakening and others to stabilization.   >The MBA&#8217;s survey covers about 50 percent of all U.S. retail residential loans.

The survey that captures sales figures did not say how big the increase was for the final week of the month.   >SpendingPulse also said a 3.7 percent year-over-year rise in spending on gasoline in December showed consumers were increasingly taking to the road to do their shopping as the impact of lower fuel prices seemed to be taking hold after three months of slightly negative sales.   >&#8220;It&#8217;s good to see consumers hitting the road more, buying more gasoline,&#8221; said Michael McNamara, vice president of research for MasterCard Advisors. &#8220;It increases the velocity of the retail economy when you see people out there hitting the stores.&#8221;   >A burst of cooler weather across the country following unseasonably warm temperatures, together with higher foot traffic from shoppers redeeming gift cards and searching for post-holiday discounts, also spurred shoppers during the last week of December, SpendingPulse said.   >The survey comes ahead of a report measuring total retail sales excluding automobiles for the month of December and after SpendingPulse data last week showed a 3 percent rise in holiday retail sales that compared to a year-ago 5.2 percent gain.   >Retailers from Federated Department Stores FD.N to Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY.N) and Gap Inc. (GPS.N) release their key December sales figures later this week.   >The week after Christmas, which can account for between 14 percent and 16 percent of December sales, saw a 9.5 percent rise in footwear -- with boots especially popular -- and an 8 percent jump in men&#8217;s apparel, according to SpendingPulse.   >But demand for electronics -- stars of the holiday season as consumers snatched up flat-screen televisions and video game consoles -- slowed the last week of December, perhaps as more shoppers gravitated to apparel, McNamara said.   >Looking ahead to 2007, McNamara said that retailers will face difficult comparisons with January 2006, when strong sales growth was fueled by record good weather.   >&#8220;There are signs of optimism but there are definitely some warning signs we have to watch out for regarding energy and housing,&#8221; he said.   >SpendingPulse reports are based on aggregated sales activity in the MasterCard U.S. payments network, coupled with estimates on all other payments forms, including cash and check.

The greenback erased losses spurred by an earlier report showing the first contraction in the U.S. private sector job market since April 2003.   > &#8220;The fact that ISM came back above 50 puts the whole soft-landing, dollar-positive scenario back in play,&#8221; said Boris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist at Forex Capital Markets in New York.   > Led by strong gains against European currencies including sterling, the euro and the Swiss franc, the dollar was set for its biggest rise in around six months against a basket of six major currencies .DXY.   > The euro EUR= was trading down 0.7 percent on the day at $1.3180, while sterling tumbled more than one percent to a session low of $1.9500 GBP=.

Ford took office on August 9, 1974, following Richard Nixon&#8217;s resignation in the worst U.S. political scandal.   >Here are some facts about Ford&#8217;s life and presidency.   >* Ford pardoned Nixon on September 8, 1974, for any crime he may have committed in office, an act that stunned the nation and stirred enduring controversy. He denied making any deal with Nixon.   >* He escaped two assassination attempts in a 17-day span in 1975, and served on the Warren Commission which investigated the 1963 assassination of President John Kennedy.   >* At the Helsinki summit of 1975, Ford and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed agreements in effect swapping Western acknowledgment of post-war Soviet domination in central Europe for Moscow&#8217;s vows to liberalize human rights and ease border restrictions.   >* Ford declared the Vietnam War &#8220;finished as far as America is concerned&#8221; on April 23, 1975, and the U.S.-backed Saigon government fell one week later. Congress had rejected Ford&#8217;s last-ditch efforts to boost military aid to Saigon.   >* Ford represented Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1949 and rose through Republican ranks to become House minority leader in the 1960s. Nixon named him vice president in 1973 after Spiro Agnew resigned the post in a corruption scandal.   >* He was the only U.S. president to have assumed office without winning a national election as either president or vice president. He lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter in his 1976 bid for a full term, in one of the closest U.S. elections in U.S. history.   >* Ford played on the University of Michigan&#8217;s national championship football teams in 1932 and 1933 and turned down offers to play with the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers in the National Football League. Instead he went to Yale University, where he went to law school and served as boxing coach. | in, U.S., 1974,

Go play them.&#8221;   >The Jets beat the Patriots 17-14, showing the fighting spirit that helped them post a 6-2 road record this season.   >Mangini has found his own style of preparing a team but acknowledges the debt he owes Belichick.   >&#8220;Philosophically there are a lot of similarities, attack weaknesses, minimize strengths and play to your strengths,&#8221; he told reporters this week about their game-planning approach.   >Mangini said the value of character was the main thing he took from Belichick and his New England experience. Atlas also touched on that area in his talk to the team.   >&#8220;My belief is that... most knockouts are allowed. Most of them are submitted to,&#8221; Atlas said about a fighter giving in when he is in trouble.   >&#8221;You allow yourself to go to the gray room and when you&#8217;re in the gray room there&#8217;s a black room behind that door. And you know what that room is. You know what it represents.   >&#8221;You have a chance to get out of it, because you&#8217;re in the gray room. You make a choice right there.

One of the things we can control in this life is how you behave.&#8221;   >Mangini wants his players to battle through adversity.   >&#8220;I&#8217;d say the one thing I took away from that whole New England experience was the value of character. To me, character wins,&#8221; the Jets coach said.   >&#8220;When things are tough... those are the guys that continue to fight.

The rest are missing,&#8221; Laxmi Prasad Manandhar, a senior official at the Department of National Park and Wildlife Conservation, said.   >But he ruled out the possibility of all the 49 missing rhinos falling prey to poachers.   >&#8220;If poachers had killed them they should have left behind the bodies&#8221; after taking away the horn, he said, adding that just one rhino skeleton had been found during an extensive search in June.   >&#8220;Where did they go? I have no answer. It is a mystery,&#8221; Manandhar said.   >The rhinos were moved to Babai Valley from Chitwan National Park on Nepal&#8217;s southern plains under a conservation scheme supported by global conservation group WWF.   >In December, Nepal&#8217;s Supreme Court ordered the government to step up security at Chitwan -- the Himalayan nation&#8217;s biggest rhino reserve -- after local media reported at least 10 animals had been killed since July.   >Officials say at least 12 rhinos had died in the past six months in Chitwan where their population dropped to 372 in 2005 from 544 in 2000.   >Their numbers fell mainly due to poaching for horns which are believed to have aphrodisiac qualities and are in great demand in China.   >In the Babai Valley, rhinos were last seen seven years ago when several security posts were closed due to threats from the Maoist rebels who targeted them during their decade-long insurgency against Nepal&#8217;s monarchy.   >The Maoists declared a ceasefire in April and signed a peace deal with the government in November, allowing easier and safer movement of forestry officials.   >Nepal began its rhino conservation drive 30 years ago when the population fell to 108 animals from around 800 in 1950. One-horned rhinos are also found in the northeastern Indian state of Assam.   >The one-horned species of the rhinoceros has been one of the greatest conservation success stories in South Asia.

The bacterial form that occurs in one in 25 cases can produce a more severe illness than the viral form.   >Doctors often cannot determine which type of meningitis a patient has until a bacterial culture is produced in the laboratory -- requiring up to a three-day wait. Just in case, most patients are admitted to the hospital and treated with powerful antibiotics.   >But guidelines developed four years ago and recently tested in a trial of 3,300 patients aged 29 days to 19 years correctly classified all but two patients, both of whom were younger than 2 months and more difficult to diagnose, according to the study published in this week&#8217;s issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.   >The criteria include routine tests of blood and fluids and a checklist, including whether the child has had seizures since falling ill.   >&#8220;The ability to identify those children who are at very low risk of bacterial meningitis and can be considered for management on an outpatient basis will avoid unnecessary hospitalization and aggressive antibiotic therapy,&#8221; said study author Dr. Nathan Kuppermann of the University of California-Davis Medical Center.   >A vaccine to combat bacterial meningitis has been recommended in the United States for at-risk children younger than 2 since 2000, reducing the incidence of the disease, the report said.   >&#8220;The finding is important because it gives emergency room physicians nationwide a tool to guide their decision-making when caring for children with suspected meningitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening infection,&#8221; said study co-author Lise Nigrovic of Children&#8217;s Hospital Boston. | four, to, finding

2007010308:45 AM EST | 2007010308:45 | Health insurance bridges gap for poor families | http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN1940733220070103 |  - For years, Al Rohling watched parents quit their jobs when their kids got sick, deliberately making their incomes drop to a point where they could get U.S. government medical help.   >Rohling, who directed Alabama&#8217;s housing authority at the time, reached a startling conclusion: If children could drive parents into hardship when they became ill, could medical insurance help parents rediscover financial health?   >&#8220;Health care for children really is a bridge to get out of poverty,&#8221; said Rohling.   >Rohling quit his job in 1988 to help set up the Child Caring Foundation, which provides free health insurance for children through the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama health care provider.   >The foundation is just one example a charity that bridges the gap between Medicaid -- subsidized insurance -- for the poorest and private health insurance paid for either privately for those who can afford it or by an employer.   >That gap leaves up to 9 million U.S. children uninsured in the United States, a nation with no universal health care, and many parents are forced to struggle with a patchwork of other provisions in order to get health care for their children.   >&#8220;The problem of the uninsured is getting worse,&#8221; and the number of uninsured children has risen since 2004, said Jennifer Tolbert, principal analyst with the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, a Washington-based think tank.   >Tolbert said it was possible the U.S. Congress could increase the scope of the State Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Progam (SCHIP) to provide greater state coverage for uninsured children when it debates reauthorizing the program next year.   >Children with health insurance are usually taken to the doctor at the first sign of illness, while parents of uninsured kids often wait because they are conscious of the cost.   >Then the child&#8217;s illness can worsen and the parent is forced to miss work to nurse the child back to health.   >In Alabama, there were 230,000 uninsured children in 1988, and that has fallen to around 70,000 due to a combination of the Child Caring Foundation and state programs.   >Jody Sharp, 60, is an example of the problem the charity aims to address.   >She and her husband adopted a foster child, Dana, from a mother who was mentally handicapped. Later, they adopted Dana&#8217;s brother Kyle who has epilepsy and asthma.   >But Sharp&#8217;s husband, the family wage earner, walked out in 1990, leaving Sharp to bring up the two children with no health insurance.   >&#8220;If you never had a child with epilepsy, you would never know how many bills you can incur. With no insurance, it&#8217;s thousands of dollars just like that,&#8221; Sharp told Reuters.   >During their two years in the Alabama Blue Cross Blue Shield program, Sharp&#8217;s children received free medical care and she found a job working with special needs children. The money saved helped her move into private health insurance.   >Some 90 percent of the 55,000 children on the program move into private health insurance within about 30 months.   >&#8220;All of us have times when we lose jobs or lose our homes. You need the support of insurance so you don&#8217;t have to worry about squeezing doctor bills out of an already stretched paycheck,&#8221; said Sharp.   >BEAR&#8216;S EYE   >To recruit families, Rohling tours the state presenting health screenings at schools with the help of volunteers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing and elsewhere.   >At one recent presentation, a student nurse pulled a teddy bear eye out of a child&#8217;s ear, ending three years of one-sided deafness. It was an example of how problems can fester for children who don&#8217;t have health insurance.   >Low cost health insurance for low income American children began in Pittsburgh in 1985 when Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western Pennsylvania insured children of laid-off steel workers. By 2006, 144,000 children were in their program.   >&#8220;There was a crisis. And the whole thing came about as an answer for how health insurance should work,&#8221; said spokesperson Denise Grabner of Highmark.   >In 1997, the program expanded to include children of the working poor when Congress enacted the SCHIP providing some matching funding.   >Alabama was the first of 20 states to participate, creating the All Kids program, with money from state settlement with tobacco companies. The program provides insurance for children above the level at which they would qualify for Medicaid.   >Many states now provide insurance for families who earn up to double the poverty rate, defined as $10,000 a year for a single person and $20,000 for a family of four. But Rohling said an individual needed to earn nearly three times the poverty level to afford private insurance.   >&#8220;We fill the void between affordability and eligibility.&#8221; | thousands, can, for

Scores of bodies have been sighted afloat or washed up on beaches.   >As of Tuesday some survivors were still on life rafts in the open water, with food being airdropped to them as rough seas and bad weather prevented rescue craft from reaching them.   >Search and rescue efforts involving military, government agency and civilian vessels, planes and helicopters have focused on saving lives first over recovering the dead.   >Another survivor at the Surabaya hospital, Refi Setiawan, a 29-year-old from Central Java, said ferry passengers were screaming hysterically as the ship started to list.   >&#8220;Panic peaked when water got to the deck. The ship slanted to the left but in a few seconds it slanted to the right and immediately capsized,&#8221; he told Reuters.   >&#8220;I, thank God, was able to hold onto a wooden panel until a fisherman helped me. I thought I was dead&#8221; after sweltering tropical heat, downpours and being tossed about in the rough seas, said Setiawan.   >High waves and strong sea currents were pushing the bodies of the dead and the living eastward in the direction of Surabaya, the capital of East Java province and Indonesia&#8217;s second largest city, Central Java province rescue coordinator Eko Prayitno told Reuters on Tuesday.   >Rescue efforts are expected to continue through at least the weekend.   >Transportation Minister Hatta Rajasa has said the Japanese-built, 2,178-ton ferry was seaworthy and had a capacity of more than 850 passengers.   >Ships and ferries are a popular means of transport among Indonesia&#8217;s 17,000 islands. However, safety standards are not always enforced, and accidents occur fairly often.   >Indonesia, the world&#8217;s fourth most populous country, is also coping with an apparent airline disaster.

It&#8217;s going to be a very competitive race.&#8221;   >Chrysler has more riding on minivans than other automakers. Its Chrysler and Dodge models are the company&#8217;s top-selling vehicles and account for almost 20 percent of its U.S. sales.   >Chrysler also sells more than twice as many minivans as the combined total for Toyota Motor Corp&#8217;s (7203.T) Sienna and Honda Motor Co&#8217;s (7267.T) Odyssey, its closest competitors.   >&#8220;The Chrysler minivan has really dominated its genre almost akin to what the Mustang has been to muscle cars and for Ford,&#8221; said Noble. &#8220;These are remarkable exceptions in the history of these companies.&#8221;   >Chrysler will take the wraps off its new minivans on Sunday, and analysts expect the redesigned vehicles to offer bolder styling and refinements intended to be parent-pleasers, such as more flexible seating and lighting.   >Chrysler, which has about 30 percent of the segment, expects a stable market for minivans as the children of Baby Boomers begin to buy for their own families.

(7203.T), it is on track to be overtaken by Toyota for the global top spot in terms of production in 2007.   > And even after the share rally of last year, GM also has a market capitalization, at $17 billion, that is just one-twelfth that of Toyota&#8217;s and one-fourth that of Honda Motor Co. (7267.T)   > The disappearance of billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, who had agitated for changes at GM before selling off his stake, removes the uncertainty of a fight for board control but also puts the spotlight back on GM management in 2007, analysts said.   > &#8220;Wagoner&#8217;s hotseat has cooled down a little bit,&#8221; Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan said. &#8220;But at the same time, the pressure has risen a bit because now there is no outside activist, it&#8217;s all about Wagoner and his strategy. So in a way Kerkorian&#8217;s departure intensifies long-term pressure.&#8221;   > &#8216;BIG BUT OUTDATED&#8217;   > GM executives say they understand the magnitude of the problems. An internal planning memo, which became public in December, describes the automaker as &#8220;big but outdated&#8221; and warns that GM&#8217;s &#8220;advantages of size and economies of scale are eroding.&#8221;   > The strategy document, first reported by the Detroit News and confirmed by GM, also says that &#8220;lack of flexibility is GM&#8217;s chief disadvantage.&#8221;   > That issue will loom large this year when GM kicks off labor talks with the United Auto Workers union aimed it clinching a new four-year contract.   > For GM, which has not faced a strike since 1998, the negotiations are expected to test a collaborative relationship with the UAW as the automaker seeks to unwind many of the costly obligations written into past contracts.   > Those include health-care costs averaging $1,500 per vehicle for GM and a &#8220;jobs bank&#8221; program that has morphed since its creation in 1984 into a nearly open-ended commitment to pay laid-off union workers.   > &#8220;What they have to get is major concessions to reduce cost, create flexibility, cut wages, retiree benefits and health-care costs,&#8221; said Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s equity analyst Efraim Levy. &#8220;They will also have to do away with the jobs bank.&#8221;   > The UAW contract does not expire until Sept. 14 and intensive talks are not expected until the summer, but in the meantime the automaker will have to clinch a deal with bankrupt former subsidiary Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK and the UAW.   > That deal, which is central to Delphi&#8217;s plans to emerge from bankruptcy, will determine the final tally for GM&#8217;s Delphi-related liability, estimated at between $6 billion and $7.5 billion.   > GM will likely be surpassed in global production by Toyota in 2007, ending a run of over 80 years as the No. 1 automaker. But some analysts say that those bragging rights should be the least of GM&#8217;s concerns.   > &#8220;It&#8217;s a great headline grabber, but it is insignificant,&#8221; Erich Merkle of IRN Inc. said. &#8220;All it means is that Toyota is a dominant competitor, but we&#8217;ve known that for years. What GM has to do, whether they are largest or second largest, is to figure out how to make money selling cars.&#8221;   > GM has several new car models hitting showrooms in 2007, including the Chevrolet Malibu, the Cadillac CTS and the Saturn Astra. It also has well-reviewed crossovers -- car-based utility vehicles that are smaller than its traditional SUVs -- such as the GMC Acadia, Saturn Outlook and Buick Enclave. The new Saturn Vue and Aura will also hit showrooms.   > &#8220;GM has accomplished a lot of the groundwork needed for a turnaround in 2006,&#8221; Tynan said.   > But they still have a lot of work to do. Their products need to sell, they need to reach out to markets they have lagged in, such as the younger buyers and the West Coast, and they need to start making a profit in North America, he said.

In Asia, seat offer and frequency rose 55 percent on the year, OAG said.   >Governments have struggled to cope with the rapid changes.   >Thailand only recently opened a new airport to replace its aging single-runway airport, while in India, steps to modernize overburdened airports have been painfully slow and hampered by protesting airport workers and communist allies.   >But while pioneer Deccan Aviation&#8217;s inaugural flight was grounded, discount carriers in India have a good safety record.   >&#8220;Because we cut costs it does not mean we cut corners,&#8221; said Ajay Singh, a director at budget carrier SpiceJet Ltd..   >&#8220;In fact, since budget carriers are newer, our fleets and crews are newer than full-service carriers.&#8221;   >Certainly, more technical snags have delayed aircraft operated by state-owned Indian, which has struggled with an aging fleet for more than a dozen years.   >New airlines including Kingfisher Airlines and budget carrier GoAir have also been quicker to adopt technology like CAT-III systems to enable them to fly in fog.   >The missing Adam Air plane is the latest in a series of incidents involving budget carriers in Indonesia.   > Elsewhere in the region, Malaysia&#8217;s AirAsia, the region&#8217;s largest budget carrier with a fleet of 50 planes, and Seoul&#8217;s Hansung Airlines have had burst tyres and bad landings. No one was injured in any of these incidents.   >Still, these instances, along with cases of misleading advertising and poor customer service, have generally given rise to the perception that discount carriers are less safe.   >&#8220;There&#8217;s definitely a psychological factor that goes against low-cost carriers,&#8221; said an analyst who declined to be named.   >&#8220;We tend to feel: they&#8217;re cheaper, so they must be cutting corners. So while there is nothing prima facie to suggest they are less safe than full-service carriers, they do have to work harder to disprove the general perception.&#8221;   >Travelers have also been quicker to damn newer Asian budget carriers than their European and American counterparts including Ryanair, easyJet and Southwest Airlines.   >&#8220;In many cases criticism has come from first-time travelers who expect too much and are quick to criticize,&#8221; said Kapil Kaul, chief executive of the Center for Asia-Pacific Aviation in India.   >Still, there are concerns about the sharp contrast in the fatal crash rates between large, first-world airlines and small ones in developing countries.   >In Africa and the Middle East, the rate of fatal accidents -- which is falling globally -- was higher in 2000-2004 than 1995-1999.   >The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is pushing airlines to sign up to the IATA Operational Safety Audit for best practice in maintenance and operations by December 2008.   >Budget carriers may have to go the extra mile.   >&#8220;They&#8217;re going to have to share more information with the public to offset any negative perception -- and it&#8217;s only a perception -- of safety standards,&#8221; Kaul said.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Jalil Hamid in Malaysia, Cheon Jong-Woo in Seoul, Teruaki Ueno in Tokyo, Jason Neely in London | while, rise, too

Domestic consumption generates about half of economic activity while tourism accounts for 6 percent.   >The stock index .SETI closed down 3.03 percent at 659.25 points in the exchange\'s first day of trade since the blasts. It fell as much as 3.93 percent to 653.14 points in early trade, its lowest since December 20.   >The bombs, which the military-installed government blamed on former politicians while admitting it had no clear idea who ordered them, killed three people, wounded 38, including nine foreigners, and ruined New Year celebrations.   >How the government handled the problem would be a major factor in how long the impact of the bombs on the financial markets lasted, said Asia Plus Securities (ASP.BK) chief executive Kongkiat Opaswongkarn.   >&#8220;It&#8217;s too early to say that the impact would be short term as all eyes are now focusing on the government&#8217;s unfoldings of the situation,&#8221; he said as several bomb scares jangled nerves further.   >&#8220;Of course, the baht will automatically be weakened as the authorities have imposed unfriendly measures to curb the baht,&#8221; Kongkiat said of the central bank&#8217;s imposition of some capital controls last month to restrain the currency&#8217;s rise.   >The baht, Asia&#8217;s fastest-rising currency against the dollar last year with an almost 14 percent rise, was trading at 35.90/36.00 baht per dollar, down from 35.46 late on Tuesday.   >Bond yields &lt;0#THTSY=&gt; on the secondary market were mixed, with long yields rising due to greater supply, but trade was thin as many investors were still away from the market, dealers said.   >Bid yields on two-year bonds THLB09NC= fell 5 basis points (bps), but five-year bond yields THLB123A= rose 9 bps to 5.2 percent. Twelve-year bond yields THLB19DA= rose 2 bps to 5.57 percent.   >Dealers said the bombs might draw investors into shifting to debt paper if stocks continued to perform poorly.   >Among big cap shares, PTT (PTT.BK), Thailand&#8217;s biggest energy firm, fell 2.9 percent to 204 baht.   >Siam Cement (SCC.BK), the biggest industrial conglomerate, was 3.3 percent lower at 234 baht, while Advanced Info Service ADVA.BK, the leading mobile phone firm, dropped 1.9 percent to 76 baht.   >Shares in tourism-related firms also suffered.   >National carrier Thai Airways (THAI.BK) sank 7.9 percent to 40.75 baht, airport operator Airports of Thailand (AOT.BK) fell 5.1 percent to 55.5 baht and hotelier Minor International (MINT.BK) tumbled 8.4 percent to 10.9 baht.   >The bomb scares also hit department store shares.

With what diplomats in the region assume was tacit U.S. blessing, its tanks, jets and troops overwhelmed the Islamists in two weeks.   >&#8220;Washington encouraged Addis Ababa to go ahead. They provided the same sort of diplomatic cover they did for Israel going into Lebanon last summer, and for similar reasons -- to keep a foothold in the region,&#8221; said analyst Michael Weinstein.   >&#8220;Ordinary Americans are fed up with foreign interventions. So what&#8217;s happened in Somalia is now going to be a preferred strategy -- using allies in the region as their catapult,&#8221; said Weinstein, a politics professor at Indiana&#8217;s Purdue University.   >Western military sources say the United States gave Ethiopia intelligence and surveillance help to accelerate its victory.   >Both Washington and Addis Ababa had portrayed the Islamists as linked to and even run by al Qaeda, putting Somalia firmly on the map of the U.S.-led global &#8220;war on terror&#8221;.   >Yet President George W. Bush, haunted by such moments as his premature declaration of victory in Iraq in 2003, and his Africa policy-makers are unlikely to be crowing victory quickly.   >Some analysts predict the Islamists, who fled rather than take heavy casualties, could regroup and fight an Iraq-style insurgency from remote corners of Somalia, or carry out bomb attacks elsewhere in east Africa.   >&#8220;The parallels with Iraq are unsettling,&#8221; said Nairobi-based Somalia expert Matt Bryden.   >There is no guarantee of peace and harmony in Somalia now that six months of Islamist sharia rule are over.   >Indeed, the rapid return of warlords to Mogadishu shows how easily it could slide back into the anarchy and chaos it has suffered since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991.   >&#8220;The Americans have learned enough in Somalia not to run up a &#8216;mission accomplished&#8217; banner,&#8221; Bryden said. &#8220;There probably is great relief in Washington ... The Ethiopian offensive was successful, civilian casualties were not too many. But there is no room for complacency.&#8221;   >Americans with good memories know that only too well.   >A disastrous attempt by U.S. forces to pacify Somalia in the early 1990s began with marines crawling up the beaches of Mogadishu in full combat gear, only to find a phalanx of waiting Western journalists rather than a hostile army.   >It ended with a humiliating withdrawal after Somali militias shot down two U.S. helicopters, killed 18 soldiers and dragged their bodies through the streets.   >&#8220;...the (American) public would not have tolerated an overt intervention again,&#8221; a European diplomat said. &#8220;It&#8217;s worked out ok for the Americans after the mess they first made.&#8221;   >Early last year, Washington was vilified in east African diplomatic circles for secretly sending money to Mogadishu warlords who promised to catch &#8220;terrorists.&#8221;   >That fueled popular resentment against the warlords, who ran Mogadishu via checkpoints and extortion, and gave the Islamists a perfect rallying cry to rise up and take the city.   >So a chastened Washington came full circle -- from firing the shots in Somalia more than a decade ago, to manipulating events behind the scenes in the two-week war just ended.   >The U.S. challenge now is to help the Somali government broaden its clan base and popular support to become a truly national authority once Ethiopia withdraws its forces, Somali experts say.   >&#8220;All Somalis have a role to play in the future of Somalia, except those who are committed to terrorism and violence,&#8221; Michael Ranneberger, U.S. ambassador for Kenya and Somalia, said in a statement. &#8220;Warlordism and clannism have no role to play in the future of a modern Somali state.&#8221;   >The Somali government could cement its ties with the United States by handing over three top terrorism suspects the U.S. believes are hiding in Somalia. U.S. officials tried with no success to persuade the Somalia Islamic Courts Council (SICC) to give up the three -- wanted for 1998 bomb attacks on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania -- during its short-lived rule.   >&#8220;The Somali government is going to need all the help it can get,&#8221; Weinstein said. &#8220;So of course it would be useful to portray itself as a partner in the war on terror.&#8221; | declaration, Matt, role

Murphy estimates Ford will lose 1.2 percentage points of market  share in 2006.   > Calyon Securities analyst Joseph Amaturo said on Friday  that Ford&#8217;s December sales would drop in part because it  stopped producing the Taurus sedan, once the top-selling car in  the United States.   > Also, truck sales will likely decline during the month,  hitting Ford hard because its F-Series trucks are the top-  selling vehicles in that segment, analysts said.   > General Motors Corp. (GM.N) sales are expected to be down  as much as 2 percent in December, while sales for  DaimlerChrysler AG&#8217;s DCXGn.DE Chrysler unit are expected to  fall about 2 percent, according to analysts.   > &#8220;The reason for the softness we are seeing is that October  and November comps were so easy because of the pull-ahead  created by summer discounts,&#8221; IRN Inc. analyst Erich Merkle  said last week.   > &#8220;But December last year started a recovery. Next year,  comps are going to get much more difficult. You are going to  see some pretty dramatic declines on a percentage basis.&#8221;   > The combined monthly U.S. market share for Detroit&#8217;s Big  Three is estimated to be 54.3 percent in December, down from  56.6 percent a year earlier and up slightly from 53.2 percent  last month, according to Edmunds.com, which tracks the  industry.   > New U.S vehicle sales for December are expected to be a  seasonally adjusted annual rate of between 16.5 million and  16.8 million vehicles, according to analysts. That would be  down from last December&#8217;s 17.1 million vehicle rate and an  increase from the 16 million rate posted in November.   > Both GM and Ford have launched year-end incentives to boost  sales. Both programs, which run through January 2, offer cash  incentives. Ford&#8217;s program also includes interest-free  financing for up to 60 months on some 2006 vehicles.    > WINNERS OF &#8216;06   > Toyota is the big winner in 2006 with sales up 12.5 percent  through November. Analysts expect the Japanese automaker to be  up about 12 percent in December.   > &#8220;Toyota should be the strongest foreign (automaker) in  December, as its year-over-year sales should benefit from its  popular, fuel-efficient small and mid-sized passenger cars as  well as its typical year-end sales event,&#8221; Calyon&#8217;s Amaturo  said.   > Asian automakers gained in 2006 because customers preferred  smaller SUVs and cars over larger gas-guzzling sport utility  vehicles, partly due to high gasoline prices.   > Toyota, Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (7201.T), Honda Motor Co.  Ltd. (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. 005380.K have a  strong car line-up.

The mela in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh made it to the Guinness Book of Records as the world&#8217;s most popular pilgrimage in 1989, after drawing a crowd of 15 million.   >* Between 50 and 70 million pilgrims were estimated to have taken part in the Maha Kumbh Mela in 2001. Its numbers dwarf the world&#8217;s other great religious pilgrimages, like the Haj, which drew some 2.5 million Muslims to Mecca this month.   >* The city of Allahabad is one of four sacred spots where Garuda, the winged steed of Hindu god Vishnu, is said to have rested while battling demons over a pitcher of divine nectar of immortality.   >* The Kumbh Mela generally rotates between Allahabad, and the other holy sites, Hardwar, Ujjain and Nasik, every three years. Allahabad&#8217;s pilgrims wash at the confluence of two of India&#8217;s most holy rivers, the Ganga and the Yamuna, and a third mythical underground river, the Saraswati.   >* Most religions practice ritual bathing for purification -- but not in such large crowds.

Needless to say, the money has been confiscated and will be put to better use.&#8221;   >The MEND said such plans endangered the lives of the hostages as their guards had orders to shoot them if any attempt was made to release them without authorization.   >Attacks on oil facilities and abductions of foreign oil workers have plagued the Niger Delta for years, but the violence worsened in 2006 and is expected to escalate further in the build-up to Nigeria&#8217;s general elections in April.   >Nigeria, an OPEC member and the world&#8217;s eighth-biggest exporter of crude, gets all its oil from the Niger Delta but the vast, impoverished region of mangrove-lined creeks and swamps has long been neglected by the central and local governments.   >Poverty and frustration at an industry that creates few jobs while polluting the environment fuel militancy and crime.   >The MEND, a faceless group which emerged in late 2005, launched a series of raids on oil facilities last February which shut down over 500,000 bpd of oil output -- a fifth of Nigeria&#8217;s oil production capacity. That output has yet to resume.   >The MEND captured dozens of expatriates during a series of sophisticated raids in January and February last year. All were released unharmed on undisclosed terms after up to five weeks.   >Kidnappings for ransom are common in the Niger Delta, but after the latest abductions the MEND said it did not want money for the four hostages. Instead, it reiterated demands for the release of two jailed leaders from the Niger Delta and compensation by companies to residents for oil spills.   >Since the December 7 abductions, the MEND has also detonated three car bombs in the delta&#8217;s main city, Port Harcourt, prompting oil majors Shell and Total to pull out hundreds of relatives of their expatriate staff.   >The MEND said on Tuesday that Roberto Dieghi, one of the Italian hostages, was suffering from various ailments and it would allow doctors from the humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Doctors Without Borders, to visit him.   >The MSF head of mission in Port Harcourt said the group had not been contacted by anyone from the MEND.   >The MEND said on Sunday that it had moved the four hostages after discovering that a local government official had managed to smuggle a mobile phone to them.

The bombs were probably the work of militants from the far south,&#8221; he said in the handwritten letter. &#8220;I want to condemn the group that was behind the bombs in the strongest terms.&#8221;   >More than 1,800 people have been killed in three years of violence in the three southernmost provinces abutting Malaysia.   >But the militants, who have not made their aims public and do not issue claims of responsibility, have never taken their campaign beyond the immediate region, a move that would represent a major escalation.   >Security analysts said that even though there were some similarities between the types of bombs used, the wide geographical spread of the New Year blasts across the capital was markedly different from serial bomb attacks in the south.   >&#8220;This has to be in some fashion linked to the former regime -- but that&#8217;s such an enormous pool of people,&#8221; said security analyst Brian Dougherty of Hill and Associates in Bangkok.   >Surayud Chulanont, Thaksin&#8217;s army-appointed successor, said on Monday that intelligence pointed to politicians who had lost power -- but added that that did not mean only Thaksin.   >He did not reveal any details of the intelligence and admitted the government did not know who ordered the bombings.   >&#8220;Briefs from various intelligence agencies, based on evidence available, show that they came from groups that have lost political powers,&#8221; Surayud told a news conference on Monday.   >&#8220;These were not just the previous government, but include all those which have lost power in the past,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We could not at this stage pinpoint which particular group was involved.&#8221;   >General Saprang Kalayanamitr, the most outspoken member of the Council for National Security (CNS), as the coup leaders call themselves, said the bombs were a clear attempt to destabilize the country.   >&#8220;I can assure you that it&#8217;s not rebels from the far south. This is because of the people who previously held power,&#8221; he told a Bangkok radio station. &#8220;They want to show that this government is failing to manage the country.&#8221;   >The confusion of messages from the army, police and government has triggered a rash of conspiracy theories.   >Among them are police seeking to head off an army-imposed reform drive, a renegade former prime minister acting in a fit of pique, or hardline elements in the army looking for excuses to perpetuate military rule. | said, rash, from

They said that they would be persecuted, but their stories were not believed,&#8221; Glendenning told Reuters.   >Glendenning, a former history teacher, heads the Sydney-based Edmund Rice Center, founded by Christian Brothers in 1996 to fight for human rights, mainly among Australia&#8217;s Aborigines.   >But since turning its attention to asylum seekers, after the Australian government used soldiers in 2001 to stop 438 mainly-Afghans onboard a Norwegian freighter from reaching Australian, its small staff have criss-crossed the world.   >From Colombia to Syria and over five continents, Glendenning, a 48-year-old father of three and a band of helpers have taken it upon themselves to verify government promises that rejected refugees are safe in the countries they are returned to.   >&#8220;We had bits of stories from people who&#8217;d been deported that they were in pretty dangerous circumstances,&#8221; Glendenning said as he headed off on another journey to India and Pakistan to record stories, photograph documents and assemble dossiers.   >&#8220;People want to tell their stories. They realize that we can&#8217;t do anything to help them, but they might be able to prevent the same thing happening to others,&#8221; he said.   >Australia has welcomed around half a million refugees since 1945, but takes a tougher line with asylum seekers who try to enter the country illegally. Around 4,000 sought entry each year between 2000 and 2003 and under government policy were detained in remote processing camps, with many later deported.   >The stories of those sent back are often shocking, says Glendenning, citing Iraqi asylum seeker Mohammed Sharif al-Saraf, a Shi&#8216;ite, who was allowed to stay in Australia for three years until 2004 but was then sent home to Iraq and killed in Baghdad after being accused of being an Australian spy.   >Al-Saraf, who left a wife and two children in Iran, had been assured by Australian authorities that he was no longer in danger in Iraq after the removal of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s government.   >Then there was an Afghan man from the minority Hazara ethnic group who Glendenning will not name, whose daughters, aged six and nine, were killed when their home was bombed in a country Canberra had promised would be safe.   >Australia&#8217;s Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 2000 asked Prime Minister John Howard&#8217;s conservative government to monitor those deported or sent home with A$2,000 repatriation payment to ensure their safety.   >In the face of official reluctance, the Edmund Rice Center has interviewed 85 former asylum seekers in 25 countries, and has spoken to upwards of 250 people about their experiences.   >Detainees peer out from behind a double fence inside the Villawood Refugee Detention Centre in Sydney in this June 9, 2005 file photo. REUTERS/Tim Wimborne/Files >The center, funded by public donations, verifies stories with the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and other rights groups, compiling them into published reports.   >But those stories have not been well received by the government, which says it has no mandate to follow up on returned asylum seekers.   >&#8220;Australia has no right to monitor a person after their departure from Australia and arrival in their home country,&#8221; a spokesman for Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone said.   >He said refugees to Australia were selected on the basis on need and recommendations by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.   >&#8220;Despite repeated requests, the Edmund Rice Center has been unable or unwilling to provide the government with sufficient information to allow its allegations to be properly examined,&#8221; the spokesman said.   >Detainees peer out from behind a double fence inside the Villawood Refugee Detention Centre in Sydney in this June 9, 2005 file photo. REUTERS/Tim Wimborne/Files >Glendenning said the government, which faces an election in late 2007 after 10 years in power, is unwilling to listen to stories which contradict its approach.   >The center has racked up what it regards as fleeting triumphs. As a result of Edmund Rice interviews, some refugees have resettled in Canada and New Zealand and an Angolan man is now working in London as a bricklayer.   >Glendenning said their stories are remarkably similar and if their tales of mistreatment are lies, then they are lies which somehow span the globe.   >&#8220;There&#8217;s either a rocket-size conspiracy or a case to be answered,&#8221; he said.   >But the search for Australia&#8217;s rejected asylum seekers is not without dangers. In Kabul, Glendenning was forced to talk his way out of jail with World Cup football stories after having guns placed against his head and chest.   >&#8220;The point is we can get out, and we can just go to the airport and get on a plane. The people that we send back cannot,&#8221; he said.   >Australia&#8217;s long reputation as a country of opportunity and equality for newcomers who make up 25 percent of the country&#8217;s 20 million population may have also been put at risk.   >&#8220;I wear a New Zealand football jersey half the time I&#8216;m in the Middle East, because Australia is extraordinarily unpopular,&#8221; said Glendenning.   >&#8220;One upon a time if you were an Australian overseas it was a passport to being embraced and welcomed, but I think our policies have deeply changed that.&#8221;    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>$1=A$1.27 | to, the, home
2007010303:25 AM EST | 2007010303:25 | Chinese hero's memory burns bright in Penang house | http://www.reuters.com/article/inDepthNews/idUSKLR3439920070103 |  - The fate of China&#8217;s last imperial dynasty was sealed in an unlikely place -- an indigo-blue shophouse jammed into a bustling commercial street on the Malaysian island of Penang.   >Here, early in the last century, Chinese revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen, shattered by the strain of leading nine failed rebellions against the country&#8217;s crumbling Qing dynasty, broke down and begged discouraged supporters to aid him one last time.   >&#8220;I will not trouble you again,&#8221; historian Khoo Salma Nasution quoted the distraught 44-year-old as telling the Chinese migrant merchants who had funded his efforts.   >&#8220;The rest was history,&#8221; she added. &#8220;The money raised from his supporters funded two rebellions in 1911, which overthrew the Manchu dynasty and made him China&#8217;s first provisional president.&#8221;   >Sun, the father of the revolution that toppled China&#8217;s last emperor in 1911, died in 1925, and is a hero in China despite being the former leader of the Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, defeated by the Communists in 1949.   >The 1910 meeting with his backers in Malaysia, known to history as the &#8220;Penang Conference&#8221;, was held in utter secrecy in Sun&#8217;s headquarters on Armenian Street, crowded round with secret society dens and temples built by migrant Chinese traders.   >Sun, a Western-educated physician exiled by the Qing government, plotted the Canton uprising from his base in the bustling then-British-controlled port of Penang on the west coast of colonial Malaya.   >Few traces of the dynamic leader remain, apart from an exhibition of photographs that commemorates his brief stay on the island, where Sun had sought refuge from the Manchu-dominated Chinese government.   >Yet the house, with its narrow passages, small courtyards, winding staircases and hidden rooms, bears powerful testimony to the secrecy that surrounded Sun&#8217;s revolutionary activities.   >&#8220;This was his life. It was always in the shadows,&#8221; said Khoo, whose family has owned the house since it was bought in the 1930s by her grandfather, an arms dealer who wanted a place to store his stock.   >Now, almost a century later, Khoo&#8217;s shophouse serves a different purpose as the home of the Lestari Heritage Network, which runs a program of heritage conservation projects around Asia, as well as a publishing firm, to document its activities.   >The network, run by Khoo, has helped fund efforts to restore heritage buildings in former mercantile and colonial centers in India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand.   >The interior of 19th century-styled shophouse at 120 Armenian Street, in Malaysia\'s town of Georgetown in the northern state of Penang, in this December 8, 2006 file photo, where in 1910, China\'s first president sealed the fate of his country\'s last imperial dynasty. REUTERS/Stringer/Files >Agencies such as the Japan Foundation and the New York-based Institute for Cultural Enterprise have helped provide the funds.   >&#8221;Sun Yat-sen used the shophouse as a base for his revolutionary activities,&#8220; said Khoo. &#8221;We are coming full circle with the shophouse as a center for heritage conservation.   >She added, &#8220;My family thought I was crazy to spend so much money and effort to restore the shophouse. But they now realize this shophouse could have been lost forever if nothing was done.&#8221;   >She declined to say how much she had invested in the project.   >Her efforts have paid off.   >Pictures of Sun Yat Sen\'s are on display at the 19th century-styled shophouse at 120 Armenian Street, in Malaysia\'s town of Georgetown in the northern state of Penang, December 8, 2006, where Sun, the China\'s first president, in 1910 sealed the fate of his country\'s last imperial dynasty. REUTERS/Stringer/Files >China officially recognized the site when President Hu Jin Tao visited the shophouse in 2002 and presented a commemorative plaque to Khoo. At the time, Hu was China&#8217;s vice-president.   >But other sites in Penang associated with Sun have slowly begun to disappear. Sun&#8217;s house, located in a different part of Georgetown, has long since been demolished.   >Sun held secret gatherings in Penang to spread his ideas about overthrowing the Qing dynasty and canvassing for funds.   >He was able to tap into the sentiments of the vibrant Chinese migrant community, which was bitterly upset over news that their home country had been ravaged by famine and torn apart by civil war and clashing warlords.   >&#8220;These buildings can piece together Sun&#8217;s Malaysia story but they face an uncertain future,&#8221; said Khoo, lamenting that agencies of the state and federal government had shown little interest in conservation efforts in Georgetown.   >&#8220;People here are slow to realize that Penang has such links to international history. It is a shame.&#8221;   >But one proof of Sun&#8217;s presence in Penang still lives on, in the form of a Chinese newspaper launched in the shophouse for distribution among his supporters.   >Today, the paper, which features Sun&#8217;s calligraphy in its masthead, is Malaysia&#8217;s longest-running Chinese daily with a circulation of up to 72,000 in 2005.   >&#8220;Sun Yat-sen knew how to move the hearts and pockets of the overseas Chinese with his speeches,&#8221; Khoo said. &#8220;The newspaper brought it to another level.

The inventory of homes shrunk 22.2 percent  from the third quarter to 5,934 and 0.5 percent from the year  ago quarter.   > Sale prices slipped 5 percent to $1,187,404 in the fourth  quarter from $1,288,748 in the third quarter 2006, but Miller  attributed that to seasonality. The price drop has happened in  each of the past 16 years, he noted.   > The average price per square foot fell 0.4 percent to $998  in the fourth quarter of &#8216;06. That was 5 percent below the  third quarter&#8217;s $1,050 per square foot.   > Meanwhile, the median sales price, in which half the units  sold were more expensive and half were less, rose 5.1 percent  to $799,000 from $760,000 the prior year but was 5.5 percent  below the third quarter 2006 median sales.   > Mortgage rates, which have held within a narrow band, and a  strong local economy have supported New York apartment prices.  But the market&#8217;s blessing, Miller said, has been the lack of  speculators who bought with the intention to quickly sell.   > Such investors, bid up prices in other markets such as San  Diego, California, Las Vegas, Nevada, and parts of Northern  California and Florida, and then hurt the markets there when  they left, driving sales down in certain markets by as 50  percent.   > Dottie Herman, chief executive of residential brokerage  company Prudential Douglas Elliman said New York apartment  prices in 2007 could be as strong as prices seen in the boom  times of 2004-2005 if inventory continues to decline, and Wall  Street bonuses get spent on apartments.   > &#8220;If you see inventory going down any further, you&#8217;re going  see what happened in 2004,&#8221; Herman said. She was referring to  the 20-plus percent price hikes seen in much of 2004 and 2005.   > &#8220;There was virtually no inventory then,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Right  now it looks healthy and balanced.

My playing days aren&#8217;t completely over but my priority now is given to CBS.&#8221;   >Faldo, Masters champion in 1989 and 1990 before claiming a third title in 1996, realized his playing days at Augusta National were probably over during last year&#8217;s tournament.   >&#8220;I stood just off the ninth fairway in the rough with a three-iron in my hand going: &#8216;I can&#8217;t hit it on the green, there&#8217;s no way I can get this damn thing on the green&#8217;,&#8221; he recalled.   >&#8221;I had giant bunkers up the left and knew, even if I hit it on the green, it would repel and bounce off.   >&#8221;So I thought: &#8216;Okay it&#8217;s getting tough now and I haven&#8217;t got the game to seriously compete at Augusta any more.&#8217;   >&#8220;Now I am quite happy to go up in the booth and do the best that I can calling the action,&#8221; added the Englishman, who missed the halfway cut at last year&#8217;s Masters after shooting 79 and 74.   >Britain\'s Nick Faldo hits from a sand trap to the second green as he practices at the Augusta National Golf Club for the 2006 Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia, in this April 3, 2006 file photo.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon started his first day on the job on Tuesday by departing from the traditional U.N. opposition to the death penalty, saying nations can make their own decision.   >Ban, a former South Korean foreign minister succeeding Kofi Annan of Ghana, was greeted by a U.N. honor guard, went to a U.N. meditation chapel to honor fallen peacekeepers, spoke to reporters and held a mass meeting with U.N. staff.   >Asked about the weekend execution of Saddam Hussein, Ban said the former Iraqi leader committed &#8220;heinous crimes and unspeakable atrocities against the Iraqi people and we should never forget the victims of these crimes.&#8221;   >But he said &#8220;the issue of capital punishment is for each and every member state to decide&#8221; and in conformity with international law.   >South Korea is among 68 nations that retain the death penalty, although Seoul is considering abolishing it.   >Groups such as Human Rights Watch have criticized the execution of Saddam, saying it was imposed after a &#8220;deeply flawed trial&#8221; with political interference. Annan and leading U.N. rights officials also have opposed capital punishment, as has the European Union.   >The U.N. special representative in Iraq, Ashraf Qazi, released a statement on Sunday saying the world body &#8220;remains opposed to capital punishment, even in the case of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.&#8221;   >Ban&#8217;s new spokeswoman, Michele Montas of Haiti, said &#8220;the U.N. policy still remains that the organization is not for capital punishment.&#8221; She said Ban&#8217;s comments were nuanced but would not say whether he agreed with Qazi.   >While Ban, 62, intends to make a fresh start, he is being pressured by the United States, Britain, France and others for control of key departments -- as were his predecessors.   >New U.N.

(QBE.AX) said on Friday it would buy Winterthur US Holdings from France&#8217;s AXA (AXAF.PA) for US$1.2 billion, making its biggest ever acquisition to boost its U.S. presence.   >Investors cheered QBE&#8217;s second major U.S. buy in two months, lifting its shares 7 percent to a record A$30.40. By 0357 GMT, QBE shares had given up some gains but were still up 5.1 percent at A$29.84 in a lower overall market.   >&#8220;If you combine this with the Praetorian acquisition that they did in December, their footprint in the U.S. is now quite large. These are two very sizeable acquisitions,&#8221; said Credit Suisse analyst Arjan van Veen.   >Wisconsin-based Winterthur US writes property and casualty insurance risks through 1,700 independent agents in 33 states of the United States.   >Gross premium income for 2007 is expected to be around US$1.45 billion and QBE forecasts the deal to add a net profit after tax of about US$160 million in the first full year.   >AXA, which bought Swiss insurer Winterthur in June last year, said in a statement that Winterthur US would repay US$636 million of inter-company loans to the Winterthur Group.   >QBE would raise about A$800 million ($630 million) in a share placement to fund part of the purchase. It will also use existing excess capital and short-term debt to fund the purchase, and its acquisition of Praetorian Financial.   >QBE last month announced purchase of Praetorian for US$800 million from German reinsurer Hannover Re (HNRGn.DE).   >Australian insurers are looking to spread overseas as they battle stagnant growth in the home market. Last year, Insurance Australia Group Ltd. (IAG.AX) made two purchases in the UK.   >Global rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s kept its ratings on QBE unchanged after the latest acquisition.   >The planned acquisition would enhance QBE&#8217;s business profile in the U.S., boosting its scale of operations and geographical reach, as well as giving it a sound distribution platform, S&amp;P said in a statement.   >The acquisition was supportive of QBE&#8217;s U.S. growth strategy S&amp;P&#8217;s credit analyst Derryl D&#8216;silva said.   >With the latest purchase, QBE would earn more than 80 percent of its premiums overseas. It has grown largely by buying small-to-medium general insurers, with annual gross written premiums of up to around A$500 million, and has concluded more than 90 buys since 1982 and operates in over 40 countries.   >Frank O&#8216;Halloran, QBE&#8217;s chief executive, said the company would be disciplined as it pursues overseas growth. &#8220;We are obviously delighted with the prices that we have paid for these acquisitions,&#8221; he said.   >&#8220;In some areas competition is raising prices, but as far as QBE is concerned we have our acquisition criteria and we will not go against that,&#8221; O&#8216;Halloran added.   >QBE will now develop its Latin American business and pursue acquisitions opportunities in Eastern Europe and Asia, he said.   >&#8220;We are not looking for large acquisitions in Latin America, we are looking at acquisitions that are very much bolt on. So that may give us a footprint,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And we are keeping our ears to the ground in Australia.&#8221;   >Following the acquisition, QBE&#8217;s debt-to-equity ratio will remain at around 40 percent, the company said. The acquisitions are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2007.   >Annualized gross premium income from QBE&#8217;s American operations is expected to be around US$4.6 billion, slightly less than 40 percent of QBE Group gross premium income.   >QBE expects to extract synergies of about A$25 million after tax by the end of 2008.   >&#8220;This is another typical QBE acquisition, multiple-wise, it&#8217;s 1.5 times NTA (net tangible assets) and obviously QBE is trading on a significantly higher multiple than that,&#8221; Arjan van Veen said.   >&#8220;PE-wise again, it&#8217;s a significant discount toward what QBE is trading at, especially if you put in the synergies,&#8221; he added.   >QBE trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 15 based on December 2007 expected profits, according to Reuters Estimates, compared with 14.7 for rival IAG. The benefits from QBE&#8217;s latest acquisition will accrue in 2008.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Ian Chua | &#8220;We, December,, premium

(GE.N) agreed to integrate its nuclear business with rival Hitachi Ltd. (6501.T).   > But Toshiba said the plan, which could allow it to build large nuclear reactors without using GE&#8217;s patents, was still at an early stage.   > &#8220;We&#8217;re brainstorming what design, what concept might work decades in the future,&#8221; Toshiba spokeswoman Hiroko Mochida said when asked about a report in the Nikkei business daily that it plans to market the nuclear power reactor from 2015.   > &#8220;There&#8217;s no concrete plan and no schedule.&#8221;   > One of the designs on the table is for a BWR with 1.6 million kilowatts of generating capacity, and Toshiba, Japan&#8217;s second-biggest conglomerate, is considering what patents and technology would be necessary, she said.   > Toshiba, which in October took control of Westinghouse, the U.S. power plant unit of British Nuclear Fuels, aims to expand its global nuclear power business by offering both BWRs and pressurised water reactors (PWRs), the two main types of reactors.   > Westinghouse is a leading manufacturer of PWRs, while Toshiba has a long-standing partnership with GE to develop BWRs using GE patented technology and supply reactors to Japanese utilities like Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501.T).   > But GE and Hitachi said in November they planned to pool their nuclear units in a $2 billion enterprise, which is seen possibly cooling ties between GE and Toshiba.

Although sales have since stabilized, the 11-year-old drug has a much-reduced market share.   >The agreement removes a weight from Lilly&#8217;s back at a time it is struggling to develop new drugs, particularly its experimental blood-thinner prasugrel, a potential blockbuster that is critical to Lilly&#8217;s future growth.   >&#8220;While we remain confident that these claims are without merit, we took this difficult step because we believe it is in the best interest of the company, the patients who depend on this medication, and their physicians,&#8221; Lilly Chief Executive Officer Sidney Taurel said.   >Still, the Zyprexa issue isn&#8217;t over. About 1,200 claims are not included in the settlements and will go to trial, beginning in April, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.   >&#8220;Lilly believes this largely resolves the issue, though we are less sure,&#8221; said Steve Scala, an analyst at Cowen and Co. &#8220;This is still a lingering issue for them, and while it doesn&#8217;t compare in scale to whether prasugrel works, it is something investors should be tracking.&#8221;   >Bank of America analyst Chris Schott said Lilly has a &#8220;high probability&#8221; of success against remaining plaintiffs. Moreover, he said he does not expect a dramatic number of new lawsuits to be filed against Lilly because the statute of limitations has lapsed.   >&#8220;Most of the commercial impact from Zyprexa&#8217;s side-effect profile has already occurred,&#8221; said Schott, noting that use of Zyprexa now appears to be concentrated among severe psychiatric patients where the drug&#8217;s benefits outweigh its risks.   >JP Morgan analyst Chris Shibutani on Wednesday said U.S. sales of Zyprexa, which fell 16 percent in 2005, should remain little changed until the drug&#8217;s U.S. patent lapses in 2011 and it faces competition from cheaper generics.   >The latest settlements will result in the dismissal of claims against health-care professionals named as co-defendants in the Zyprexa cases.   >Most of the plaintiffs&#8217; claims stated that before September 2003, the package insert warning of a potential link between Zyprexa and elevated blood sugar or diabetes was not sufficiently clear.   >In September 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required makers of atypical antipsychotics such as Zyprexa to add more information to their package inserts related to diabetes.   >The New York Times last month said internal Lilly documents indicated Lilly for years has kept important information from doctors about Zyprexa&#8217;s links to obesity and elevated blood sugar.   >Lilly&#8217;s own published data, which it told sales representatives to play down in conversations with doctors, showed 30 percent of patients taking Zyprexa gain 22 pounds or more after a year on the drug, with some reporting gains of 100 pounds or more, the Times said in its front-page article.   >Lilly, reacting to the Times story, said it was based on &#8220;selective documents illegally leaked&#8221; by plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers.   >While nearly all of the newer class of atypical antipsychotics are associated with weight gain, many psychiatrists consider Zyprexa to be the worst offender, although it was also shown in a recent federally funded trial to be one of the most effective in treating schizophrenia.   >Shares of Lilly were up 10 cents to $52.35 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. | Chris, be, claiming

He&#8217;s a very competitive player.&#8221;   >Bogut claims he no longer feels he has a bull&#8217;s eye on his back following his selection out of Utah as the top pick in the draft.   >&#8221;For me, it&#8217;s gone,&#8220; said Bogut, who left Utah after his sophomore season after earning consensus Player of the Year honors. &#8221;I had a hell of a year in college and got a lot of awards. I think I deserved to be that pick.   >&#8220;People are always going to pick at you, no matter how good you are, no matter how bad you are. I&#8217;ve done better than several other top picks in the last five or six years. So I&#8216;m not too worried about that anymore.&#8221;   >Bogut, sixth in the league in shooting percentage at .568, does the little things that help a team win. He is an excellent passer and runs the floor well for a big man. It is not unusual for him to lead the Bucks in assists.   >But Bogut, who featured for Australia at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, is not concerned about his statistics.   >The Bucks (16-16) were ousted in the first round of the playoffs last year by Detroit, an experience that only whetted his appetite.   >&#8220;Just getting to the playoffs last year and getting a taste of it was unbelievable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Getting to the second round is my next goal. That&#8217;s what I really want.&#8221;   >Bogut believes he can average 20 points a game in the NBA but would rather win a title.   >&#8220;If we went to an NBA championship and I scored 10 points a game, got some rebounds, passed the ball well, took charge and blocked shots, I&#8217;d be happier with that than averaging 20 points.&#8221; | many, year., getting

(Ryanair Chief Executive Michael) O&#8216;Leary just seems to take pride in refusing to recognise that climate change is a genuine problem.&#8221;   > The Guardian said O&#8216;Leary had vowed to boycott an EU carbon trading scheme, and it quoted Pearson as describing his attitude as &#8220;completely off the wall&#8221;.   > The U.S. airline industry also needed to change, Pearson said.   > &#8220;They just seem to be saying they don&#8217;t want anything to do with the trading scheme, and that they will take the EU to court if transatlantic flights are included. It is completely irresponsible,&#8221; Pearson was quoted as saying.   > Last month, the European Union&#8217;s executive arm approved plans to include aviation in its emissions trading system.   > &#8220;Even British Airways (BA) are only just playing ball. They say they are happy with a trading scheme that is confined to flights within Europe, rather than one that includes all flights departing the EU,&#8221; Pearson said.   > The trading scheme -- the bloc&#8217;s key tool to battle global warming and meet Kyoto Protocol emissions reduction targets -- puts a limit on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) big polluters, such as power plants and oil refineries, can emit.   > Ryanair was not immediately available for comment but a spokesman defended its position in the Guardian.   > &#8220;Mr Pearson is sadly misinformed. Ryanair has spent over $10 billion on a fleet of fuel-efficient engines which have reduced fuel burn by 45 percent and cut CO2 emissions by 50 percent per passenger, making Ryanair Europe&#8217;s greenest airline,&#8221; the spokesman was quoted as saying.   > BA was also not immediately available for comment.   > David Castleveter, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association of America (ATA), the industry trade organization of the leading U.S. airlines, said the group was in favor of a voluntary program on emission control.   > Airlines are not the great polluters as proclaimed by others, he said. &#8220;We represent less than 3 percent of total emissions.&#8221;   > Last month the ATA put out a statement on the matter.   > &#8220;ATA is disappointed that the European Commission remains intent on unilaterally covering the flights of non-European Union carriers in its emissions trading scheme,&#8221; the December statement said.   > &#8220;This misguided decision clearly violates international laws and bilateral air service agreements, and deferring its implementation by one year does not change that outcome.&#8221;    | refusing, (ATA),, international

Hamas, in contrast, has refused to recognize Israel&#8217;s right to exist, to respect past peace deals or to renounce violence -- three conditions for ending a Western aid boycott.   >&#8220;One of the prerequisites for really making progress on a political horizon between the Israelis and Palestinians is the Palestinians sorting out (their) political differences,&#8221; McCormack said. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean that in the interim you cannot work with those who are partners for peace.&#8221;   >If she travels to Israel and the Palestinian territories, it would be Rice&#8217;s eighth visit to the region in less than two years. Rice&#8217;s last visit was in late November, when she met Abbas in the West Bank town of Jericho and Olmert in Jerusalem.   >McCormack said Rice would not travel before President Bush gives a speech outlining his new approach toward Iraq.

But nevertheless, he was given justice,&#8221; Bush said. &#8220;The thousands of people he killed were not.&#8221;   >White House officials said earlier that Bush had not seen the execution video but had been briefed. The U.S. military insisted it had no role in the hanging and would have handled it differently.   >Merkel made no mention of Saddam&#8217;s execution after White House talks, in keeping with the softer approach she has taken compared to her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, an outspoken critic of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.   >But she and Bush discussed the situation in Iraq.   >&#8220;Although Germany is not militarily present in Iraq, we have every interest in seeing Iraq taking a turn for a more peaceful development, where people no longer need to be in fear for their lives,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Politically, we shall do everything we can in order to give support to such a positive development.&#8221;   >Bush said he was still in consultations but would be ready next week to &#8220;outline a strategy that will help the Iraqis achieve the objective of a country that can govern, sustain and defend itself.&#8221;   >Bush is considering a short-term increase in U.S. troops mostly to Baghdad, where sectarian violence and insurgent attacks have made a mockery of U.S.-led security efforts.   >He did not say whether he would announce plans to send more troops, but White House spokesman Tony Snow acknowledged that the president saw the need for &#8220;sufficient force&#8221; in Baghdad.   >Democrats, who won control of Congress from Bush&#8217;s Republicans in November&#8217;s elections largely propelled by public disapproval of the war, took command of both houses on Thursday promising to challenge Bush&#8217;s war policies.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Tabassum Zakaria | been, through, order

It could eventually sell the technology in countries in other countries such as Canada and Mexico, Samsung spokesman John Godfrey said.   >The development comes as the world&#8217;s wireless companies, including Samsung&#8217;s mobile handset division, sell more handsets that can play video.   >Samsung said its portable TV technology, known as Advanced Vestigial Sideband, could potentially work on cellphones, but it is focusing initially on car TVs and dedicated media players.   >&#8220;We would like to expand the market by developing TVs that people could carry around with them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a different way to bring portable to the consumer but it&#8217;s not about the cellphone.&#8221;   >Samsung hopes the technology will become a standard in the first half of 2007, according to Godfrey.

Other guards have identified them as having filmed the hanging,&#8221; Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki&#8217;s aide Sami al-Askari told Reuters.   >President Bush spoke to Maliki in a secure videoconference call on Thursday and agreed that investigating the recording of the execution was the right thing to do, White House spokesman Tony Snow said.   >Bush, who is developing a new strategy on Iraq that could be unveiled as early as next week, spoke to Maliki about the &#8220;way forward&#8221; but not about his specific plan.   >One option Bush is considering is a temporary increase in troops, but Snow would not say whether that was discussed in the conversation with Maliki.   >&#8220;They were talking about the importance of having sufficient force within Baghdad to create a stable situation within the city,&#8221; Snow told reporters.   >Michigan Democrat Senator Carl Levin said Bush was likely to link any short-term increase in U.S. troop levels to certain conditions.   >Levin, incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said he believed Bush would &#8220;at a minimum&#8221; reverse the open-ended nature of the U.S. troop commitment in Iraq.   >A short-term troop increase is one of the policy changes under consideration which has won most attention in Washington, as U.S. military casualties in Iraq have climbed above 3,000.   >An American soldier was killed in western Baghdad on Thursday after his patrol came under attack from small arms fire, the U.S. military said in a statement.   >Two bombs exploded earlier near a petrol station in Baghdad&#8217;s western Mansour district, killing at least 13 people and wounding 22, police said.   >A prosecutor who attended Saddam&#8217;s execution told Reuters he had seen two senior officials filming the hanging, prompting suggestions among some Iraqis that the guards might be used as scapegoats.   >Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani told a news conference: &#8220;The investigation is ongoing and we have identified those who flouted the rules ... Even for a dictator like Saddam, the law must be obeyed.&#8221;   >The images, which show observers yelling &#8220;Go to hell&#8221; and chanting the name of a radical Shi&#8216;ite cleric before Saddam falls through the trap, have sparked angry demonstrations by Saddam&#8217;s fellow Sunnis, fearful of Shi&#8216;ite ascendancy. Moderate Sunnis say it deals a blow to Maliki&#8217;s call for reconciliation.   >In Ramadi, the capital of Iraq&#8217;s restive western province of Anbar, U.S. commanders met tribal chief Sheikh Sattar al-Buzayi, the U.S. military said in a statement on Thursday.   >They discussed action being taken by Iraqi security troops with the help of U.S.-led forces in the region, the statement said but gave no further details. U.S. forces conducted a string of raids in Ramadi on Wednesday and detained 23 suspects with ties to senior Al Qaeda leaders.   >Buzayi is head of the Anbar Salvation Council, an umbrella group of tribes in Anbar frustrated with al Qaeda&#8217;s growing influence in the province.   >Barzan al-Tikriti, one of Saddam&#8217;s half-brothers and his former intelligence chief, and Awad al-Bander, a former judge, were found guilty with Saddam two months ago over the killings of 148 Shi&#8216;ite men from the town of Dujail in the 1980s.

New House  Majority Leader Steny Hoyer says Democrats will repeal several  energy tax breaks in the law, including one that allows oil  companies to speed up writing off some exploration and drilling  expenses.   > He also said the legislation would fix faulty drilling  leases issued by the government in 1998 and 1999 that  mistakenly allowed energy companies to avoid paying royalties  on the oil and gas they find on federal offshore sites in the  very deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.   > New House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to use the money  raised from repealing the oil industry tax breaks and the  additional oil royalties to fund research for developing  alternative energy sources.   > Pelosi said Democrats will work to create &#8220;a new America  that declares our energy independence, promotes domestic  sources of renewable energy, and combats climate change.&#8221;   > The American Petroleum Institute, the main lobbying group  for oil and gas companies, says Congress should leave the tax  breaks alone, because higher drilling and exploration expenses  would reduce the incentive to search for new energy supplies.   > &#8220;How can you argue that raising costs to the industry helps  consumers?&#8221; asked API chief economist John Felmy.   > However, U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman has said oil and  natural gas prices are high enough to ensure energy companies  make a nice profit even without the tax breaks. And the heads  of major oil companies testified at a Senate hearing last year  that their firms don&#8217;t need the energy tax relief that  Democrats now want to roll back.   > The API also doubts that a government created fund to  develop alternative energy sources would do much good, as  lawmakers might send money to pet research projects in their  districts.   > Senate Democrats plan to make energy reform legislation  among their first 10 bills introduced.   > &#8220;For too long our country&#8217;s energy policy has had only one  concern -- oil company profits,&#8221; said Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid. &#8220;We&#8217;ve allowed Exxon&#8217;s bottom line to take priority  over families struggling at the gas pump.&#8221;   > Like the House, the Senate measure would repeal industry  tax breaks and promote alternative energy. The Senate bill  would boost federal authority to prevent gasoline price  profiteering and cut heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.    > The API says Democrats should not force oil companies to  renegotiate the faulty drilling leases signed with the  government in the late 1990s, or require the companies to pay  the past royalties that would have been due.   > Felmy said the leases were signed in &#8220;good faith,&#8221; and if  the U.S. government reneged on them, governments in other  countries where U.S. oil companies do business would feel  justified in imposing new terms on their drilling contracts.   > The API says it should be left up to oil companies to  voluntarily agree to renegotiate the U.S. drilling leases.   > A handful of oil companies, including BP Plc (BP.L) and  ConocoPhillips (COP.N), have already reached new deals with the  government to pay royalties on future production from the 1998  and 1999 leases, but not past royalties.

Introduced last year by Miller, a California Democrat, it would require employers to recognize a union after a majority of workers sign cards authorizing union representation.   >Miller is the new chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee. The Senate&#8217;s companion card-check bill is backed by Massachusetts Democrat Edward Kennedy.   >The chamber -- whose members could face more union organizing pressure if the bill becomes law -- opposes it, saying the bill would deprive workers of a secret ballot election on union representation and invite harassment.   >Pelosi last month committed to taking action in early 2007 on the bill, a central objective of the labor movement.   >Frank is calling for a &#8220;grand bargain&#8221; between businesses and workers to break what he sees as legislative gridlock on economic growth initiatives. He is urging the business community to give ground on worker and environmental issues key to the Democrats&#8217; agenda.   >He said he is planning committee hearings on wage inequality and &#8220;what we can do about it.&#8221;   >The massive severance package for Nardelli, who oversaw an 8-percent decline in Home Depot&#8217;s stock price during his tenure, prompted Frank to criticize soaring executive pay and reiterate that he will introduce a shareholder rights bill.   >Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission have attempted before to set new rules making boardrooms -- where executive pay is set -- more accessible to shareholders. | in, agenda., opening

Bush appears to have concluded he needed another diplomatic heavyweight to grapple with foreign policy crises from Iraq to North Korea, U.S. officials and analysts said on Thursday.   >The move, which a senior official said was expected to be announced on Friday, has perplexed some in Washington because Negroponte would leave what is ostensibly the top job in U.S. intelligence for the secondary State Department post.   >It has also caused dismay among key U.S. lawmakers, who fear Negroponte&#8217;s departure as the director of national intelligence (DNI) will set back the effort to reform U.S. spy agencies after the September 11 attacks.   >&#8220;I&#8216;m troubled by his departure. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind it. It just strikes me as, wow, we just got this thing settled,&#8221; said Michigan Democrat Sen. Carl Levin, the incoming chairman of influential Senate armed services committee.   >But analysts and U.S. officials said foreign policy challenges from the war in Iraq to North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs meant someone of Negroponte&#8217;s stature was needed to support U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.   >&#8220;Major issues have got to be dealt with and if you want to actually continue to push to make progress ... you need another heavyweight,&#8221; said a senior official, saying Negroponte was likely to pay special attention to Iraq and North Korea.   >&#8220;There is a lot we have to accomplish diplomatically and while reorganizing the intelligence services in the government is a key job, right now I think there is ... a greater sense of urgency for the diplomatic (goals),&#8221; said another senior U.S. official.   >James Steinberg, a deputy White House national security adviser under former President Bill Clinton, questioned whether the Bush administration was seriously committed to the DNI position, created after the September 11 attacks to try to ride herd over the U.S. intelligence community.   >&#8220;They have never been deeply committed to the intelligence reform. It was not something they sought,&#8221; said Steinberg. &#8220;I think ... what they really cared about was getting Iraq right and getting somebody over there to work on that full time.&#8221;   >Analysts described Negroponte as the perfect choice to become deputy to Rice, citing a 40-year diplomatic career that included five ambassadorial assignments, including at the United Nations and in Iraq.   >A senior government official who spoke on condition that he not be named said Bush was expected on Friday to nominate Negroponte to become deputy secretary of state.   >The official said Bush will likely tap retired Navy Admiral John McConnell, who directed the National Security Agency from 1992 to 1996 and is now at the Washington contracting and consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, to replace Negroponte.   >The deputy&#8217;s job has been open since Robert Zoellick left to join Goldman Sachs last July.   >Another key aide, former State Department counselor Philip Zelikow, is returning to academia and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton stepped down last year.   >Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, is expected to be nominated the next U.S. envoy to the United Nations, said U.S. officials, and U.S. ambassador to Pakistan Ryan Crocker is the leading candidate to succeed Khalilzad in Baghdad.   >&#8220;In some ways, it is putting Negroponte back where his true strength lies, which is as a career diplomat,&#8221; said James Dobbins, a former State Department official who served with Negroponte and is now an analyst at the Rand Corporation.   >News of the appointment sparked speculation that Negroponte might eventually replace Rice, should she move on.   >White House spokesman Tony Snow rolled his eyes when asked if Negroponte might have been tapped as an understudy to Rice, who tutored Bush on foreign policy during the 2000 presidential campaign and was his first national security adviser.   >Several officials said they had no reason to believe Rice planned to leave before Bush&#8217;s term ends in 2009.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Susan Cornwell, Steve Holland and David Morgan | said, key, on

Hamas, in contrast, has refused to recognize Israel&#8217;s right to exist, to respect past peace deals or to renounce violence -- three conditions for ending a Western aid boycott.   >&#8220;One of the prerequisites for really making progress on a political horizon between the Israelis and Palestinians is the Palestinians sorting out (their) political differences,&#8221; McCormack said. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean that in the interim you cannot work with those who are partners for peace.&#8221;   >If she travels to Israel and the Palestinian territories, it would be Rice&#8217;s eighth visit to the region in less than two years. Rice&#8217;s last visit was in late November, when she met Abbas in the West Bank town of Jericho and Olmert in Jerusalem.   >McCormack said Rice would not travel before President Bush gives a speech outlining his new approach toward Iraq.

2007010405:55 PM EST | 2007010405:55 | Bogut blossoms after casting aside top pick stigma | http://www.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUSN0448860620070104 |  - Australian-born center Andrew Bogut, the number one overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft, is making even more of an impact this season after helping the Milwaukee Bucks to the playoffs in his rookie season.   >&#8220;In the last 21 years, there have been only four number one picks to make the playoffs in their rookie season: David Robinson, Chris Webber, Tim Duncan and Andrew Bogut. That&#8217;s pretty good company,&#8221; said coach Terry Stotts.   >Bogut&#8217;s scoring, rebounding and assists are all up this year. So are his minutes played, shooting percentage, and free-throw accuracy.   >&#8221;Last year I was worried about getting the ball, worried about all that type of stuff,&#8220; Bogut told Reuters in a locker room interview. &#8221;This year I&#8216;m just going out there any playing.   >&#8220;The difference between this year and last has been night and day since I&#8217;ve learned how to be a professional.&#8221;   >Bogut, 22, is averaging 11.7 points, 8.2 rebounds and 3.2 assists a game this season. While those are solid numbers, many believe the number one collegiate pick should exhibit All-Star credentials right out of the gate.   >Stotts believes the burden associated with being the top draft choice is exaggerated.   >&#8221;The expectations of a number one pick, especially since they&#8217;ve become younger and younger, it&#8217;s a little but unfair,&#8220; he said. &#8221;Andrew had a very solid rookie season and he helped us make the playoffs.   >&#8220;He&#8217;s gotten better this year. He has more responsibility and statistically he&#8217;s improved. His interior play is one of the reasons why we had a really good December. He&#8217;s a very competitive player.&#8221;   >Bogut claims he no longer feels he has a bull&#8217;s eye on his back following his selection out of Utah as the top pick in the draft.   >&#8221;For me, it&#8217;s gone,&#8220; said Bogut, who left Utah after his sophomore season after earning consensus Player of the Year honors. &#8221;I had a hell of a year in college and got a lot of awards. I think I deserved to be that pick.   >&#8220;People are always going to pick at you, no matter how good you are, no matter how bad you are. I&#8217;ve done better than several other top picks in the last five or six years. So I&#8216;m not too worried about that anymore.&#8221;   >Bogut, sixth in the league in shooting percentage at .568, does the little things that help a team win. He is an excellent passer and runs the floor well for a big man. It is not unusual for him to lead the Bucks in assists.   >But Bogut, who featured for Australia at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, is not concerned about his statistics.   >The Bucks (16-16) were ousted in the first round of the playoffs last year by Detroit, an experience that only whetted his appetite.   >&#8220;Just getting to the playoffs last year and getting a taste of it was unbelievable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Getting to the second round is my next goal. That&#8217;s what I really want.&#8221;   >Bogut believes he can average 20 points a game in the NBA but would rather win a title.   >&#8220;If we went to an NBA championship and I scored 10 points a game, got some rebounds, passed the ball well, took charge and blocked shots, I&#8217;d be happier with that than averaging 20 points.&#8221; | and, draft., I

(HD.N) Chairman Robert Nardelli&#8217;s abrupt resignation came with a $210 million severance package, chamber president Tom Donohue said he expects a vigorous debate in the new Congress over executive pay and shareholder rights.   > But he warned of a &#8220;serious problem&#8221; if lawmakers move to give shareholders more boardroom power and union pension funds take advantage of it to advance nonbusiness political goals.   > On the question of making it easier for workers to organize, Donohue said: &#8220;We will go all out to oppose union efforts ... They will have a major fight on their hands.&#8221;   > Stewart Acuff, organizing director for the AFL-CIO labor group, called it an &#8220;incredible irony&#8221; that so soon after the Nardelli news, Donohue should vow to renew the chamber&#8217;s &#8220;fight to keep workers from forming unions to improve their lives.&#8221;   > Donohue threw down the challenge to Democrats as they gathered to formally assume power, opening what is likely to be the least business-friendly Congress in a decade.   > Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, supports measures both to make union organizing easier and boost shareholder rights.   > Along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. George Miller, Frank backs the Employee Free Choice Act, known as the &#8220;card-check&#8221; bill. Introduced last year by Miller, a California Democrat, it would require employers to recognize a union after a majority of workers sign cards authorizing union representation.   > Miller is the new chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee. The Senate&#8217;s companion card-check bill is backed by Massachusetts Democrat Edward Kennedy.   > The chamber -- whose members could face more union organizing pressure if the bill becomes law -- opposes it, saying the bill would deprive workers of a secret ballot election on union representation and invite harassment.   > Pelosi last month committed to taking action in early 2007 on the bill, a central objective of the labor movement.   > Frank is calling for a &#8220;grand bargain&#8221; between businesses and workers to break what he sees as legislative gridlock on economic growth initiatives. He is urging the business community to give ground on worker and environmental issues key to the Democrats&#8217; agenda.   > He said he is planning committee hearings on wage inequality and &#8220;what we can do about it.&#8221;   > The massive severance package for Nardelli, who oversaw an 8-percent decline in Home Depot&#8217;s stock price during his tenure, prompted Frank to criticize soaring executive pay and reiterate that he will introduce a shareholder rights bill.   > Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission have attempted before to set new rules making boardrooms -- where executive pay is set -- more accessible to shareholders.     | Massachusetts, becomes, chamber

Bush&#8217;s Iraq war policies, help the poor and middle class and clean up how lawmakers do business.   >On the first day of a two-year session, the House of Representatives made history by electing liberal Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California the first female to lead the 218-year-old chamber as its speaker.   >It also marked the first time in his six years as president that Bush will not have fellow Republicans controlling either the House or Senate.   >In the other legislative chamber, newly installed Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said: &#8220;The war in Iraq will cast a long shadow over the Senate&#8217;s work this year.&#8221;   >Pelosi delivered her first speech as speaker of the House, warning that the elections were &#8220;a call to change&#8221; that went far beyond Democrats&#8217; taking power from Republicans.   >&#8220;Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq,&#8221; Pelosi said, adding that voters &#8220;rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.&#8221;   >Democrats are expected to use their newly acquired committee chairmanships to build public support for a phased troop withdrawal from Iraq with a series of hearings examining the buildup and prosecution of the conflict.   >The new spirit of bipartisanship that was on display on Congress&#8217; first day will be tested by the Iraq war.   >Bush soon will unveil a new Iraq strategy that could include increasing combat troop levels, a move opposed by most Democrats.   >Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi speaks after being elected the first ever female Speaker of the House of Representatives on the first day of the 110th Congress, January 4, 2007.

Hillary Clinton, strolled through the Senate press gallery just before noon. &#8220;I came to apply for a job,&#8221; he joked.   >Celebrities watching the House proceedings included singer Tony Bennett, songwriter Carole King and screen actor Richard Gere.

It will probably be by the end of the second month  of the year,&#8221; Chrysler Group Chief Executive Tom LaSorda told  reporters on a conference call.   > He added: &#8220;It will outline what we need to do on a wide  scope of business, and I&#8216;m not providing any details until that  day.&#8221;   > LaSorda also said Chrysler would remain open to  product-focused alliances like the one it has clinched with  China&#8217;s Chery Automobile Co. to produce a new small car for  export to Europe and the United States.   > &#8220;The opportunities outside the U.S. are becoming more and  more important,&#8221; LaSorda said.   > Chrysler announced a partnership with Taiwan&#8217;s China Motor  Corp.(2204.TW) to export cargo vans to Mexico.   > Under the deal, China Motor, which now makes a  Chrysler-branded minivan for sale in Taiwan, would produce a  Dodge-branded cargo van at its assembly plant in Yangmei,  Taiwan, for the Mexican market, Chrysler said.   > Chrysler said it would also license China Motor and Fujian  Motor Group of Fuzhou, China to make a minivan for the Chinese  market.   > &#8220;There are ways to capture growth in different ways rather  than putting a lot of your own capital out there,&#8221; LaSorda  said. &#8220;So we&#8217;ll look at those kinds of opportunities.&#8221;   > Chrysler&#8217;s U.S. sales slipped 7 percent in 2006, although  sales outside the United States were up almost 7 percent. On a  global basis, vehicle sales fell 4.5 percent.   > In the U.S. market, DaimlerChrysler, which includes the  parent company&#8217;s Mercedes brand, slipped to become the No. 4  player, behind Toyota Motor Corp.(7203.T), which saw its own  sales rise 13 percent.   > Like other automakers, Chrysler is expected to face a flat  to weaker market for vehicles sales in the United States this  year, and LaSorda said the company would increasingly look for  growth outside North America.   > The company has previously said that its restructuring plan  would look to cut $1,000 from the cost of each vehicle  produced. Analysts have expected it to consider shutting a  plant and asking the United Auto Workers for concessions on  health care costs.   > Chrysler has said it expects to report a 2006 loss of some  $1.3 billion. Inventories of unsold trucks and sport utility  vehicles have piled up and strained relations with U.S.  dealers.   > Chrysler is moving toward offering smaller vehicles to  lessen its reliance on SUVs, trucks and minivans and target a  segment of the market expected to be boosted by the consumer  concern over high fuel prices.   > The new small car that Chery is to build for Chrysler would  allow the automaker to compete for very young buyers and those  for whom a cut-rate price is the most important consideration,  Chrysler said in a statement.   > Chrysler also said it would launch production of its  Sebring sedan in China for sale in that market later this year.   > The production would be at the same plant run in a joint  venture between DaimlerChrysler and Beijing Automotive Industry  Holding Co. that currently builds the Chrysler 300C and  Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedans for sale in China.   > Four-cylinder engines for the Sebrings Chrysler will sell  in China would be manufactured at Chrysler&#8217;s &#8220;global engine&#8221;  plant in Michigan.

Customer traffic fell about 2 percent, and the average check rose between 2 percent and 3 percent.   > Darden said a shift in the timing of the Christmas holiday to Monday in 2006 from Sunday in 2005 helped boost same-store sales at both chains by about 1 percentage point.

Analysts said the testimony was a factor in a subsequent rise in financial market inflation expectations.   > Bernanke &#8220;told me it is worrisome to him that anyone would think of him as dovish, that that feeling did permeate last week,&#8221; Bartiromo said in her report.   > His supporters say that misstep was minor and has not hurt his credibility.   > &#8220;That was an inexperienced driver accident,&#8221; Rivlin said of the episode.

Critics faulted him for associating himself with an administration diplomatic initiative to push China to allow the value of its yuan currency to strengthen.   > &#8220;As Fed chairman, he is or ought to be politically independent, and the perception of that independence is crucial to his credibility,&#8221; the Wall Street Journal said in an editorial.   > Others, however, noted Bernanke&#8217;s predecessor Alan Greenspan traveled with administration delegations. &#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine that you would want the Fed chairman to stay home,&#8221; Rivlin said.   > Bernanke&#8217;s description of China&#8217;s exchange rate policy as an &#8220;effective subsidy&#8221; during the trip also raised objections.   > Critics said the remarks may have given ammunition to lawmakers who want to threaten China with economic sanctions.   > But not everyone thought the remark inappropriate.   > &#8220;It seemed rather a small rebuke in the context of his speech, which was a very laudatory take on the Chinese economic experience,&#8221; said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody&#8217;s Economy.com in West Chester, Pennsylvania.   > Most importantly, data appears to be bearing out the Fed&#8217;s forecast of slower growth leading to lower inflation, while the softness is not so great as to stir fears of recession.   > &#8220;His economic forecast is coming to pass, at least so far, and his timing with respect to ending the steady tightening in policy between mid-2004 and mid-2006 seems dead-on,&#8221; Zandi said.   > More broadly, Bernanke faces the challenge of following Greenspan, whose prestige and mystique grew over 18-1/2 years at the head of the central bank.   > The owlish Greenspan&#8217;s steady hand during crises -- from the 1987 stock market crash to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- and the record 10-year economic expansion during his tenure raised him to a position of authority rarely achieved by public figures.   > Where Greenspan was famous for his circumlocutions, Bernanke, a former Princeton University economics professor and the pride of the small town of Dillon, South Carolina, is making his own mark with plain statements on the economic outlook and a careful evaluation of risks associated with slowdowns in housing and manufacturing.   > &#8220;I&#8217;d have to say careful and analytical are the phrases that I think of when I think of this first year, and I think that&#8217;s perfectly consistent with his strong academic background,&#8221; said former Fed Governor Susan Phillips, now dean of the George Washington University business school.   > &#8220;Whether or not they&#8217;ve nailed the proverbial soft landing, time will tell -- but so far, it looks pretty good,&#8221; she said.     | economic, >, would

John Rockefeller of West Virginia, Democratic chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement.   >To address such concerns, Bush was expected to nominate retired Navy Adm. Mike McConnell to replace Negroponte as early as Friday, a senior administration official said.   >McConnell directed the National Security Agency from 1992 to 1996 and intelligence sources speculated that the former military commander would place greater emphasis on the domestic intelligence operations of the FBI and Department of Homeland Security.   >Negroponte, whose job was created by Congress in late 2004, became President George W. Bush&#8217;s top intelligence adviser in April 2005 when U.S. intelligence was still reeling from major lapses involving Iraq and the September 11 attacks.   >Experts have given Negroponte high marks for assembling a talented staff of senior intelligence professionals and fostering the seeds of cooperation between agencies including the CIA and FBI.   >&#8220;He was just beginning to make the progress that the intelligence reform act of 2004 envisioned in improving the collection and analysis and sharing of intelligence information,&#8221; said Sen. Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who helped write the legislation setting up the new intelligence agency structure.   >But word of the 67-year-old career diplomat&#8217;s move to the No. 2 post at the State Department also brought a sense of relief to others who viewed his agency as another bureaucracy, with 1,500 staff members and a tepid performance record.   >John Pike, director of the online think tank GlobalSecurity.org, said Negroponte showed early fortitude in dealings with contractors involved in a top secret satellite project in 2005.   >&#8220;It was the make or break of whether he could make hard decisions stick. He passed the test,&#8221; said Pike. &#8220;But if he&#8217;s done anything major since, he&#8217;s certainly avoided telling anyone about it.&#8221;   >A main concern for critics and advocates alike was that a change in leadership after so short a tenure would disrupt the continuity necessary to shepherd reforms still in their infancy.   >Some noted that Negroponte&#8217;s former principal deputy, Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden, left his post to become CIA director early last year and has not been replaced.   >But Richard Posner, a federal appellate judge and a noted authority on intelligence, said McConnell would provide Bush with a candidate who exhibits the right mix of intelligence experience and management skill.   >&#8220;There&#8217;s some loss of continuity and it&#8217;s unfortunate. But this is essentially a management job, and Adm. McConnell seems to offer the right formula,&#8221; Posner said.   >The judge was among several experts including former intelligence officials who viewed Negroponte as best suited to diplomacy.   >&#8220;This is a chance to get the round peg in the round hole, and the square peg in the square hole,&#8221; Posner added. | adviser, in, former

Retailers, who can only book revenue after the cards are used, count on customers spending more once they walk through their doors.   >&#8220;Most retailers gain 70 to 80 percent of gift card redemptions within the first two weeks following Christmas,&#8221; said J.&amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co. equity analyst Chris Kagaoan. &#8220;That should benefit sales overall in the first part of January.&#8221;   >But for some retailers, the likely gift card redemptions will not be enough to overcome December&#8217;s weakness.   >AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ANN.N, Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, and Chico&#8217;s FAS Inc. (CHS.N) warned that their sales or earnings for the fourth quarter or fiscal year ending in January could be less than expected.   >Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N) maintained its fourth-quarter profit forecast, which was in doubt after its U.S. sales at stores open at least a year fell in November. The retailer said December sales at U.S. stores open at least a year -- known as same-store sales -- rose 1.6 percent, but it only forecast a 1 to 2 percent rise in January U.S. same-store sales.   >Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, said December marks the third straight month that the majority of retailers missed sales expectations.   >Overall, December same-store sales rose 3.2 percent, according to Retail Metrics, compared with a 3.4 percent rise a year ago.   >According to the International Council of Shopping Centers, combined November and December same-store sales at U.S. chain stores rose 2.8 percent. That was within the ICSC&#8217;s forecast for a 2.5 to 3.0 percent rise but trailed last year&#8217;s 3.6 percent gain.   >Investors are keeping a close eye on sales to see if the slowdown in the housing market will take a bite out consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.   >Perkins said consumer spending seemed &#8220;subdued,&#8221; and the results were &#8220;a little bit concerning as we head into &#8216;07.&#8221;   >The S&amp;P Retail Index .RLX, which bounced between positive and negative territory, finished the trading session almost flat at 502.77.   >Investors carefully watch retailers&#8217; holiday sales, because the November and December period can account for 20 percent to 40 percent of annual revenues.   >The holiday season got off to a strong start during the three-day post-Thanksgiving weekend as retailers opened their doors before dawn. Customers lined up as early as midnight to take advantage of &#8220;doorbuster&#8221; bargains, like 42-inch plasma TVs priced below $1,000.   >But after cherry-picking sale items during the Thanksgiving weekend, consumers took a break at the beginning of December, waiting for stores to entice them with last-minute discounts.   >The weather did not help apparel sales. Last month was the warmest December in the United States in at least 10 years, according to weather tracking firm Planalytics.   >Kohl&#8217;s Corp. (KSS.N) Chairman and Chief Executive Larry Montgomery said last-minute shoppers and gift-card redemptions spurred sales in the final two weeks of December, which helped offset weak demand for items like sweaters and boots.   >But AnnTaylor said December was its &#8220;most challenging&#8221; month of the year, and sweater, outerwear and accessory sales at its Ann Taylor Loft stores were &#8220;especially disappointing.&#8221;   >Gap Inc.&#8217;s (GPS.N) December sales at stores open at least a year fell a worse-than-expected 8 percent after it resorted to markdowns to drive shoppers into its Gap and Old Navy stores.   >The struggling retailer cut its fiscal year outlook, and said it is reviewing Gap and Old Navy brand strategies.   >Wal-Mart said its December apparel sales were &#8220;soft,&#8221; but by cutting prices it helped boost sales.   >It also noted that sales of electronics -- one of the holiday season&#8217;s hottest categories -- were strong.   >Wal-Mart has been aggressively promoting flat-panel televisions, hoping to steal sales of the high-priced items from consumer electronics retailers like Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY.N) and Circuit City Stores Inc.

FD.N, warned that their sales or earnings for the fourth quarter or fiscal year ending in January could be less than expected.   > &#8220;From a bondholder&#8217;s standpoint, (the December sales were) a non-event, really,&#8221; said Matthew Mish, credit derivatives strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.   > &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see a whole lot (of trading activity) away from Gap,&#8221; Mish said.   > The cost to insure Gap Inc.&#8217;s (GPS.N) debt from default rose by about 5 basis points to 125 basis points, or $125,000 per year to protect $10 million of debt for five years, Mish said.   > Gap reported that sales at stores open at least a year fell a sharper-than-expected 8 percent, after it resorted to markdowns to drive shoppers into its Gap and Old Navy stores. [ID:nN04478683]   > &#8220;We would not be surprised by further rating actions after today&#8217;s grim news, and we expect more aggressive shareholder enhancement tactics,&#8221; Gimme Credit&#8217;s Carol Levenson said of Gap in a report.   > But credit default swaps of other retailers like Limited Brands Inc. LTD.N did not widen even after tepid sales results. &#8220;I would have expected to see a little bit&#8221; of activity with Limited, Barclays&#8217; Mish said.   > Federated&#8217;s bond spreads were unchanged even after the department store warned of weaker future earnings. Its 5.90 percent bond due in 2016 was steady at 117 basis points over U.S. Treasuries, according to MarketAxess.   > One reason for the muted market response is that retailers&#8217; December results did not depart drastically from expectations, analysts said. The rise of gift cards also dilutes the sway of December sales, since retailers expect consumers to redeem holiday gift cards in the first few weeks after Christmas.    > But some retailers&#8217; credit spreads -- possibly those in the apparel sector -- could widen if their earnings arrive below expectations when they are reported between February and April.   > &#8220;If they had to do a lot of discounting and promotional activity to generate sales, and apparel didn&#8217;t sell well, it&#8217;s going to clearly impact margins,&#8221; Gimme Credit&#8217;s Mann said. &#8220;We just don&#8217;t know how severely.&#8221;   > One likely candidate for spread widening is Toys R Us TOY.N.   > &#8220;Built into (Toys R Us&#8217;) spread was that they were going to have a decent Christmas,&#8221; Mann said. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s some risk that sales will be disappointing there, and if margins are a little worse than what people think, that&#8217;s a bond that (will see) spreads back up.&#8221;     | Mish, lot, some

All I want is to find out how my son is but I don&#8217;t know how I can do it,&#8221; Malawi&#8217;s Daily Times newspaper quoted Yohane Banda as saying.   >&#8220;I only talked to her once at the High Court and I want to talk to her now and find out about my child.&#8221;   >The father of one-year-old David Banda made the comments after the newspaper presented him with a 400 pound ($788) check from Scottish nun, Christine Webster, who told the paper she believes Banda would have been better off staying in Malawi.   >Madonna&#8217;s adoption of the child grabbed world headlines and caused some rights groups in Malawi to question whether she had used her celebrity to bypass laws governing the adoption of Malawians by foreigners.   >Madonna signed interim adoption papers when she and her husband, film maker Guy Ritchie, visited in October on what they said was a humanitarian mission to help Malawi orphans.   >Under the interim order, the child was to stay with Madonna for 18 months during which time his progress would be monitored by Malawian officials before deciding whether final approval may be given for him to remain with her family.   >The High Court order angered human rights groups who described it as illegal and took the issue to court.   >The high court has since granted the advocacy groups an application to be part of the adoption proceedings of Madonna, a move which offered some relief for her as it did not amount to a green light for the rights groups to mount a full challenge against the adoption.   >The controversy over Madonna&#8217;s adoption of the boy has helped to spotlight the plight of orphans in Malawi.   >Over 900,000 children in Malawi are orphaned and another 500,000 have lost at least one parent.   >Banda dismissed any suggestions that he wants the child back and asked human rights groups not to interfere in his attempts to speak with Madonna.   >&#8220;All I want is to find out how my child is doing and not to have him back,&#8221; he was quoted as saying. | as, adoption, as

Bush is likely to link any short-term increase in U.S. troop levels in Iraq to political milestones or other conditions, a key Senate Democrat said on Thursday, saying he might consider backing such a &#8220;surge&#8221; if those conditions are right.   >Michigan Democrat Sen. Carl Levin also predicted the Republican president would soon find a way to end the &#8220;open-ended commitment&#8221; of U.S. troops to Iraq, even if Bush does propose a short-term boost in forces.   >&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe the president is simply going to say, &#8216;We&#8217;re going to increase troops in Iraq,\'&#8221; Levin told reporters outside the Senate. &#8220;It&#8217;s likely the president would add something of a conditionality to it.&#8221;   >&#8220;The (recent congressional) election is far too clear, that the public wants to change course and find a way out of Iraq and not get in deeper in Iraq,&#8221; said Levin, who is the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.   >The White House says Bush is preparing to unveil a new strategy on Iraq that could come next week.   >A quick, short-term troop increase, or &#8220;surge,&#8221; is just one of many policy changes under consideration to try to reverse the deteriorating situation. But it is the one that has garnered the most attention in Washington, as American military deaths in Iraq have climbed above 3,000 and analysts question whether a troop increase can stem violence.   >While the war&#8217;s unpopularity helped Democrats win majorities in November congressional elections, lawmakers could probably not stop a quick boost in U.S. troops without cutting off war funding, which they have so far been unwilling to do.   >But Congress, with its new Democratic majority, could pass resolutions calling for a drawdown of U.S. forces if it does not like Bush&#8217;s new strategy, Levin said.   >The new speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, California Democrat Nancy Pelosi, said the American people had &#8220;rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.&#8221; In her first remarks as speaker, she said Bush should make clear to the Iraqis that they must defend their own security so the United States can &#8220;responsibly&#8221; redeploy its troops.   >While he had no information on Bush&#8217;s intentions, Levin said he thought Bush would &#8220;at a minimum&#8221; reverse the open-ended nature of the U.S. troop commitment in Iraq.   >&#8220;I predict, whatever kind of surge he&#8217;s going to propose, that he&#8217;s going to find a way to correct the statement that he made twice to the Iraqis that we&#8217;re there as long as the Iraqis want us to be there,&#8221; Levin said.   >Levin said any temporary &#8220;surge&#8221; he might consider backing, would need to be combined with the announcement of a reduction in U.S. forces starting in four to six months, and set political milestones for Iraq to meet.   >Options developed by military planners could include up to 30,000 additional troops, according to defense officials. The United States now has 132,000 troops in Iraq.   >Some other key Democrats, such as Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden, incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, have rejected the idea of a U.S. troop &#8220;surge,&#8221; calling it the &#8220;absolute wrong strategy.&#8221; Republicans appear divided on the issue, with Arizona Sen.

The Dow reached a fresh intraday peak on Wednesday, the first trading day of 2007.   > On Thursday, however, falling oil prices proved a drag on stocks as energy companies like Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) took a big hit. Exxon was the heaviest weight on both the blue-chip Dow average .DJI and the broader Standard &amp; Poor\'s 500 Index .SPX and limited their gains. The Dow was up 12.50 points, or 0.10 percent at 12,487.02, while the S&amp;P 500 was up 2.75 points, or 0.19 percent at 1,419.35.   > The Nasdaq gained 1.2 percent, boosted by Intel&#8217;s climb after a brokerage raised its profit forecasts on the chip maker for the quarter and 2007.

Still, Denison warned that the massive U.S. trade deficit would likely continue to pressure the greenback. &#8220;Dollar weakness is not over,&#8221; she said.   > For now, though, the greenback was being bolstered by the likelihood of steady interest-rate policy from the Federal Reserve. No move on rates from the Fed means the United States will continue to have the highest official interest rates among rich countries, making dollar assets comparatively more attractive.   > U.S. crude oil for February delivery CLG7 settled at $55.59 a barrel, down $2.73.   > COMEX February gold GCG7 fell $6.80 to $623.00 an ounce, in response to the dollar&#8217;s rise against the euro.   > The dollar, however, slipped against Japan\'s yen JPY= to 119.06 yen from 119.35 yen late Wednesday on the view that the Bank of Japan may raise interest rates again as early as this month.   > The session&#8217;s second-tier batch of economic data did nothing to alter the outlook for monetary policy, which has had an unusually big bearing on financial markets over the past six months -- mostly because of the uncertainty surrounding the Fed&#8217;s next move.   > Factory orders rose less than expected in November after a massive October downturn.

Mubarak said Egyptian law allowed the passage of money and Egypt would not hesitate to intercept weapon shipments.   >The summit in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh appeared to make a bad start after Israeli forces mounted a rare raid into Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinian Authority, killing three Palestinians and detaining four wanted men.   >Mubarak said: &#8220;I expressed to the prime minister our indignation at what happened today in Ramallah and said that Israel and all the people in the region will achieve peace only by refraining from all practices which obstruct its course.&#8221;   >Olmert said he apologized if innocent people were injured in the Israeli raid but defended the operation in principle.   >&#8220;One must remember that Israel must take measures to prevent terrorists from harming Israeli citizens... during the operation, there were shots fired at Israeli soldiers and I am sorry to say events unfolded in an unforeseen fashion,&#8221; he said.   >Olmert avoided a question on whether Israel favored the proposed summit meeting with Mubarak, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and King Abdullah of Jordan.   >He said he had already met all three leaders over the past few weeks. &#8220;Of course, any meeting, with any line-up, can contribute to strengthening ties, improving the atmosphere and promoting the chances of serious and responsible negotiations between the Palestinians and us,&#8221; Olmert said.   >&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t prevent there being a four-way meeting to endorse the essence of those positions,&#8221; Mubarak added.   >The two leaders, at their second meeting in Egypt since Olmert took office a year ago, showed different perspectives on how to resume peace talks, which collapsed in 2001.   >Mubarak dismissed Olmert&#8217;s argument that the presence of the Islamist group Hamas in the Palestinian cabinet was an obstacle.   >&#8220;Then try with the Palestinian Authority. It is the one delegated for this,&#8221; he said, turning the news conference into a direct dialogue between himself and his guest.   >&#8220;In Egypt here, when (late President Anwar) Sadat signed the peace treaty, there were elements who did not agree to the peace agreement, but peace happened, with the majority of votes, almost by consensus, because peace is life,&#8221; he added.   >Mubarak also played down the significance of the rockets which Palestinian militants fire into Israel, provoking Israel into reprisals and straining a tentative ceasefire.   >&#8220;These Qassam rockets. They&#8217;ll fire them every other day. Shall we stop the peace process because one or two individuals fire rockets? We must proceed with the peace process,&#8221; he said.   >Olmert and Mubarak said they had talked about Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who has been held in Gaza since June and who is at the center of negotiations of an exchange for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli jails.   >Mubarak said he hoped for an early agreement. Olmert added: &#8220;I can&#8217;t reveal any more on this issue, as Gilad Shalit is still being held by elements that do not want to recognize Israel or hold talks with it.&#8221;   >Before the summit opened, Egypt blamed Palestinian indecision for a lack of apparent progress toward an Israeli-Palestinian prisoner exchange.   >Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit told Reuters: &#8220;They (the Palestinians) are the ones holding the Israeli soldier.

Sheehan, whose son was killed in the Iraq war, has become a well-known peace activist in the United States.   >Cuba&#8217;s Communist government -- which has long condemned the prison camp run by its political enemy the United States -- has said the protesters can march to the Cuban security fence surrounding the U.S. base, said Matt Daloisio, spokesman for Witness Against Torture.   >Witness Against Torture is a Catholic group in New York that helped organized the protest with CODEPINK, a women&#8217;s pacifist group based in Los Angeles, and Global Exchange, a rights group based in San Francisco.   >Washington has faced steady criticism over the Guantanamo prison from human rights groups and foreign governments, because most of the prisoners have not been charged and because of reports of abuse of prisoners. The United States has said it does not use torture, and that the camp was necessary to deal with the particular circumstances of its war on terrorism.   >Twenty-two Witness Against Torture members marched in protest to the Guantanamo base in December 2005 but did not get beyond the Cuban security gate some 5 miles from the U.S. naval base.   >The activists plan a conference on prison abuses and screenings of the award-winning docudrama Road to Guantanamo, which recounts Iqbal&#8217;s ordeal from his arrest in October 2001 in Afghanistan to his release from Guantanamo with four other Britons in March 2004.   >&#8220;I am traveling all the way from Dubai because my heart is overflowing with grief over the abuse and ongoing detention of my son,&#8221; said Deghayes&#8217; mother, Zohra Zewawi, in a statement. She says her son has been tortured and blinded in one eye during detention.   >The U.S. military has quickened the pace for releasing captives held at Guantanamo. The Pentagon said in December that the prison&#8217;s population now stands at approximately 395 inmates, out of more than 770 who have been held there since the camp opened in January 2002.   >Asked about the planned protest outside the base, Col. Bill Costello, spokesman for the U.S. military&#8217;s Southern Command, which oversees the Guantanamo base, said, &#8220;I think we have demonstrated during the past five years that Guantanamo Bay is a detention facility that is run in a safe, humane, legal and transparent manner.&#8221;   >&#8220;There have been scores of soldiers, sailers, uniformed service members and civilians who have operated the camps in just a tremendous fashion,&#8221; he added.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Jane Sutton in Miami | Road, son, miles

He said she had done more in less than a year than the outgoing Liberals had in 12 years in power.   > &#8220;But we recognize that, particularly when it comes to clean air and climate change, that Canadians expect a lot more. We&#8217;ve put an experienced minister into that portfolio,&#8221; he said.   > Harper addressed reporters outside his residence without an overcoat, rare in the world&#8217;s third-coldest capital in January, as the temperature climbed to 9 degrees Celsius (48 degrees Fahrenheit).   > He made seven cabinet changes and added six secretaries of state, junior ministers who are not part of the full cabinet but who sit on cabinet committees and give greater visibility to the Conservative team.   > Harper kept Finance Minister Jim Flaherty in his job as he drafts a budget, most likely to be delivered in February or March, that could trigger the next election.   > One of the three opposition parties must back the budget or the government will fall. Harper said it was important to have the right team &#8220;as we face the possibility of an election.&#8221;   > He said he did not intend to call an election, and whether the other parties decide to pull the plug may depend partly on their poll standings.   > The Conservatives had slipped marginally behind the Liberals in public support, partly over the environment, but the latest survey showed them pulling ahead again.   > A Decima survey taken Dec. 27-30 and provided to the Canadian Press news agency put the Conservatives at 34 percent and the Liberals at 31 percent. The leftist New Democrats stood at 15 percent and the separatist Bloc Quebecois at 10 percent.   > Newly minted Liberal leader Stephane Dion has made the environment his top priority and has sharpened his attack on what he says have been inadequate Conservative measures to arrest global warming.   > &#8220;Do they want to pretend to do something?&#8221; he asked after the shuffle. &#8220;What Canada needs is a major shift.&#8221;   > As environment minister, Baird&#8217;s task will be to put the Conservatives back on the offensive on environmental issues and he can be expected to finger the Liberals for letting emissions rise far above targets set by the Kyoto protocol.   > &#8220;Canada has perhaps the worst record of any developed country in the world,&#8221; said Harper. &#8220;We have a lot of work to do and this is not an easy file.&#8221;   > Baird is quick on his feet and is known for his aggressive attacks on the opposition during parliamentary debates. He takes credit for pushing through legislation to clean up government after the previous Liberal administration fell into disgrace over a corruption scandal.   > Harper made reporters chuckle when he said that Baird, who can go red in the face as he parries opposition attacks, had his own communications style. But the prime minister promised the change would be substantive and not just cosmetic.   > &#8220;Communications alone will not address the challenges that we face in terms of the environment and climate change in particular,&#8221; he said.   > Ambrose moved to minister of intergovernmental affairs, which involves promoting Canadian unity. She replaced Peter Van Loan, who took over as House leader from Rob Nicholson. Nicholson became justice minister replacing Vic Toews, who replaced Baird at the head of the Treasury Board.   > David Emerson, who negotiated an end to Canada&#8217;s long-standing softwood lumber dispute with the United States, stayed on as trade minister, while Peter MacKay remained foreign minister.    class=Attribution_content_27_rw>Additional reporting by Louise Egan\n\n\n | the, Liberals, the

There&#8217;s a high degree of uncertainty, but we still expect February to average near to below normal.&#8221;   >The shift would end several weeks of abnormally high temperatures that have undercut demand for natural gas and heating oil and left typically snowy cities like Duluth, Minnesota, with the first green Christmas in decades.   >Forecasters said the cooler weather would likely mean temperatures in the Midwest and along the East Coast will average near to slightly below normal for the second half of January, with the potential for some snow and brief cold spikes.   >&#8220;We&#8217;ll be getting back to normal, maybe a little below normal,&#8221; said Jim Rouiller, senior meteorologist at Planalytics. &#8220;This could also bring our first real snow threat.

2007010402:43 PM EST | 2007010402:43 | Gene linked to childhood kidney cancer identified | http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSN0417281420070104 |  - Scientists have identified a gene linked to the most common type of kidney cancer in children, and expressed hope this might help doctors determine which young patients are most at risk of dying.   >Writing on Thursday in the journal Science, Massachusetts General Hospital researchers said about 30 percent of cases of the cancer called Wilms tumor involve mutations in a gene called WTX located on the sex-determining X chromosome.   >About 90 percent of childhood kidney cancer cases are Wilms tumor. It occurs in roughly one in 10,000 children worldwide. It is treated with surgery and chemotherapy, with about 80 percent of patients surviving. It usually appears by age 5.   >The disease also is called nephroblastoma.   >&#8220;The typical treatment for these children is you remove the kidney that&#8217;s affected. If they have tumors in both kidneys, you take out one kidney and part of the other kidney and then you give chemotherapy,&#8221; said Dr. Daniel Haber, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center.   >&#8220;Twenty percent of these children will then have a recurrence of their tumor and die of their disease. So, clearly, if you could identify them up front, you would give more aggressive treatment,&#8221; Haber, senior author of the study, said in an interview.   >Haber said he hoped scientists can now determine whether the WTX gene can help predict the severity of a child&#8217;s case of Wilms tumor to help guide treatment. Haber added if doctors were able to determine a child had a less-threatening case, they could tailor less-intensive treatment.   >&#8220;There&#8217;s always an interest in pediatric cancers to try to lessen the amount of treatment if you could only identify markers of who has less-aggressive disease,&#8221; Haber said.   >The kidneys filter the blood and rid the body of unneeded water, salt and waste in the form of urine. Childhood kidney tumors originate in the early stem cells -- those that will form the organ -- of the kidney&#8217;s filtering mechanism, the researchers said.   >Scientists in 1990 identified mutations in another gene, called WT1, linked to Wilms tumor, but it is implicated in only about 5 percent of cases. Haber&#8217;s team looked at tumor samples from 82 patients to try to find further genetic abnormalities linked to the disease.   >The WTX gene, they found, is in play in cells important to embryonic kidney development, indicating it may have a significant role in the organ&#8217;s formation. The discovery also indicates that X chromosome genes may have a bigger role in cancer than previously believed, they said. | kidney, surviving., an

That year was marred by the SARS outbreak in Toronto and power blackouts in Ontario.   > The S&amp;P/TSX composite index gained 17 percent in 2006 on a total-return basis, capping four years of double-digit gains, the report said.   > So far this year, the benchmark index has suffered steep declines, reversing a modest 15-point gain in its debut 2007 session.   > It was down more than 170 points on Thursday afternoon. That followed a 200-point drop on Wednesday. The steep decline has been largely due to a pullback in oil and metals prices.   > Unusually warm weather continued to take its toll on the price of oil, which has fallen to below $57 a barrel, and copper prices continued to slide as investors sold on demand jitters.     | more, It, light

Traders have also been betting on the rerun of a seasonal pattern in recent years in which the dollar tends to decline in December and rebound in January.   >&#8220;The usual seasonal factors are helping the dollar,&#8221; said Marc Chandler, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. &#8220;And we&#8217;ve had a string of quite strong economic data. ... I still think the biggest risk we have to face this year is a reacceleration of the economy.&#8221;   >The dollar gained across the board, except against the yen. The Japanese unit was bolstered by the growing view that the Bank of Japan may raise interest rates again as early as this month.   >The euro EUR= was down 0.5 percent at $1.3093 in mid-afternoon New York trade. The dollar also rose 0.5 percent to 1.2320 Swiss francs CHF=.   >Among the biggest losers were the high-yielding Australian and New Zealand dollars, which lost 0.7 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.   >&#8220;When the euro is struggling to make new highs against the dollar, dollar bullishness filters through to other currencies,&#8221; said Joe Francomano, vice president of foreign exchange at Erste Bank. &#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s all subject to change because of tomorrow&#8217;s (U.S.) payroll number.&#8221;   >Meanwhile, the yen strengthened across the board, taking a lead from a spike in Japanese government bond yields on Thursday. Japanese news media have reported over the past week that the Bank of Japan will discuss lifting the overnight lending rate to 0.5 percent at its next policy meeting on January 17-18.   >The dollar fell 0.1 percent against the Japanese currency JPY= to 119.25 yen. The euro fell 0.6 percent against the yen   >The ISM&#8217;s report on the non-manufacturing sector showed the index slipped to 57.1 in December from 58.9 the previous month, broadly in line with expectations. Meanwhile, pending home sales slipped slightly in November, but held above lows touched last year, suggesting the sector may be stabilizing.   >With that data out of the way, the market&#8217;s attention will swing to the government&#8217;s nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, the most closely watched barometer of the U.S. labor market.   >Some forecasters have ratcheted down their forecasts for jobs growth in December since Wednesday, when the ADP National Employment Report showed the first monthly net job loss in the private sector since 2003.   >Economists expect jobs growth of 100,000 for the month, the median estimate of a Reuters survey shows, a decline from 132,000 in the previous month.

GT.N will stop producing tires at its Valleyfield, Quebec, plant and turn the facility into a materials mixing center by the end of June, cutting 800 jobs, the company said Thursday.   > Goodyear, the No. 1 U.S. tire maker, expects to save about $40 million a year under the plan, which will cut the hourly and salaried work force at the unionized plant to 200 from about 1,000.   > &#8220;While we have long suspected the plant was a potential target for shutdown, we are surprised at how quickly the closing will happen,&#8221; J.P. Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note.   > Goodyear in December settled a strike by the United Steelworkers that had lasted nearly three-months at 16 facilities in the United States and Canada, obtaining relief from retiree health-care liabilities, an eventual plant closing in Texas and other savings.   > The tire maker is in the midst of a multiyear restructuring that includes plant closings, asset sales and other measures. Part of the plan has included reducing high cost production capacity in North America to compete with low-cost imports.   > Valleyfield, whose union workers are covered by different agreements and were not on strike, has the capacity to make about 7 million tires a year and the closing will bring total production cuts at high cost facilities to 21 million tires, Goodyear said.   > The Akron, Ohio-based tire maker had planned to cut capacity by up to 20 million tires by 2008, or as much as 12 percent of its high cost capacity.   > Goodyear sold more than 226 million tires in 2005, including 101.9 million in its North American Tire unit. The company produces tires, other rubber products and chemicals at more than 100 facilities in 29 countries. It has about 80,000 workers worldwide.   > The rest of the high-cost capacity cuts will come from the United Kingdom, New Zealand and a unionized plant in Tyler Texas that is expected to close after the end of 2007 under the United Steelworkers master contract approved last week.   > Tyler has about 1,100 union workers and a production capacity of about 9 million tires a year. Goodyear had planned to close the plant early in 2007.   > In total, Goodyear expects the plant closings to save about $125 million a year, within its goal to cut annual costs by $100 million to $150 million.   > Goodyear expects to take charges of $115 million to $120 million, or $165 million to $170 million after tax, for restructuring and accelerated depreciation at Valleyfield, with most of the charges in the fourth quarter.   > Goodyear shares were down 33 cents, or 1.45 percent, at $22.47 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

Bush will lose &#8220;fast track&#8221; trade negotiating authority and could scuttle efforts to secure free trade deals with Peru, Colombia and other countries, analysts said.   >Unless there is an unexpected breakthrough in the troubled Doha round of world trade talks, trade promotion authority -- the current name for the law that puts trade agreements on a fast track through Congress -- will probably expire in June, analysts said.   >Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel have promised to work with the White House on trade but they don&#8217;t represent the mainstream of the Democratic party which is very wary of trade deals, said Grant Aldonas, who worked for Bush as Commerce Department undersecretary until 2005.   >&#8220;There are some enormously constructive people on the Democratic side and two of them happen to be the chairman (of a critical committee),&#8221; said Aldonas. &#8220;So the real question is how they create the political space to get something done at a time when the mood is distinctly opposed to trade.&#8221;   >In a piece published on Thursday in the Wall Street Journal, Baucus called for renewal of &#8220;fast-track negotiating authority&#8221; to conclude -- if possible -- a long overdue deal in world trade talks and to pursue potential bilateral trade deals with the European Union and Japan.   >&#8220;Fast-track authority should be improved as it is renewed,&#8221; with better labor and environment provisions and other measures aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit and helping workers who have lost their jobs because of trade, Baucus said.   >But Greg Mastel, a former Baucus aide who now works at the Miller &amp; Chevalier law firm, said he was skeptical the White House and Democrats could agree on a plan to prevent trade promotion authority from expiring.   >&#8220;That ... requires a certain amount of trust on both sides. Trust between the administration and the Congress on trade is at a very low ebb right now,&#8221; Mastel said.   >An early indication of the White House ability&#8217;s to work with Democrats on trade is a free trade pact with Peru and another with Colombia.   >&#8220;I expect the Democratic majority is going to insist pretty strenuously that there be provisions ... that protect the freedom to associate and the freedom to bargain collectively. That&#8217;s going to be tough for the Bush administration to swallow,&#8221; said Sherman Katz, a trade policy analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.   >Presidents highly prize trade promotion authority, which used to be called &#8220;fast track,&#8221; because it forces Congress to approve trade pacts on an up or down vote without allowing changes to be made.   >Trade promotion authority lapsed in 1994 when President Bill Clinton was in power, and he was never able to get it back. It was renewed in 2002 after a bitter fight between Democrats and Republicans.   >Some analysts believe the White House could win a temporary extension of trade promotion authority if there is breakthrough in world trade talks, which have been stuck for years on difficult agricultural issues.   >But that would require the Bush administration to &#8220;take on Republican constituencies -- the cotton lobby, the sugar lobby, the textile lobby -- that they haven&#8217;t been willing to do so far,&#8221; said Ed Gresser, trade policy director at the Progressive Policy Institute.   >Hoping for breakthrough in world trade talks to revive the Bush administration&#8217;s trade agenda is probably wishful thinking, Aldonas said, because &#8220;Doha is dead.&#8221; | textile, the, prevent

No dates have been fixed.   >A Taliban spokesman said last month that the group might join the jirgas if asked, but Omar rejected the proposal.   >&#8220;The only people who would participate are those who have sold out to foreign powers.

Sainsbury , Waitrose, Wal-Mart&#8217;s Asda , Marks and Spencer and McCain.   >The coalition&#8217;s campaign, which will run for 18 months and has divided the British industry, is the biggest joint initiative ever by the food industry with GDA labels added to nearly 40 percent of UK retail food and drink packs.   >Tesco, Britain&#8217;s biggest retailer which is leading the campaign, has 4,000 products already under its own plan and will be marking up thousands more.   >Yet, labeling is not showing uniform signs of success.   >Studies in the United States have shown although half of Americans regularly read food labels, many of them lacked the skills to understand them.   >&#8220;All moves to improve labeling have to applauded,&#8221; Tesco Chief Executive Terry Leahy said last year. &#8220;But our scheme works best for us and our customers.&#8221; | spearhead, scheme, salt,
2007010401:29 PM EST | 2007010401:29 | Is Colombia as safe as the U.S.? Poll says yes | http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN0428248020070104 |  - Cities in Colombia, the world&#8217;s biggest cocaine exporter infamous for crimes related to its four-decade-old guerrilla war, have become as safe as those in the United States, according to a poll by a Bogota think tank.   >Urban crime has fallen as part of President Alvaro Uribe&#8217;s popular crackdown on Marxist rebels who still control wide rural areas. He has stepped up patrols to reduced kidnappings on the highways.   >From October 2005 through the same month last year, 15 of every 100 Colombians said they had been the victim of some type of crime compared with 17 out of every 100 in the United States, said the poll published on Thursday by the Security and Democracy foundation.   >&#8220;Colombians have developed sophisticated techniques of survival, such as refusing to give out personal information and women driving with their bags in the trunk of their cars rather than in the passenger seat. This helps,&#8221; said Pablo Casas, who prepared the poll.   >The survey, held in Colombia&#8217;s six biggest cities, also showed the Andean country compares well with Great Britain, which registers 24 crime victims out of every 100 citizens.   >The think tank said the poll is 95.5 percent reliable and more accurate than official figures as many crimes go unreported here.   >It did not take into account the thousands who are killed or displaced in the war every year, or the average three Colombians per day who step on land mines.   >Despite billions of dollars in U.S. aid aimed in part at fighting Colombia&#8217;s insurgency, the guerrillas still rule wide swathes of countryside with an iron fist. Their operations are funded by cocaine trade, and to a lesser extent by kidnappings.   >The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, dragged four civilians out of their village homes and executed them on January 1 in northern province of Antioquia, local officials said.   >&#8220;The government has a lot to do before it can claim to have taken control of the whole country,&#8221; Casas said. &#8220;Illegal groups are still fighting for control of rural cocaine-producing land, and that accounts for Colombia&#8217;s overall high murder rate.&#8221;   >Twenty six Colombians out of every 100,000 are murdered with firearms each year compared to the world average of three to four out of every 100,000, according to the United Nations. | figures, cars, October

One MW can power about 700 California homes.   > The Central Valley licensing review projects are the $85 million, 120-MW Starwood-Midway LLC Power Plant and the $170 million, 200-MW Bullard Energy Center LLC plant.   > The natural gas-fired plants will produce electricity during periods of high demand.   > The Starwood-Midway project will connect to PG&amp;E&#8217;s transmission grid and supply electricity to the utility under a 15-year power purchase contract. Construction is scheduled to begin in June 2008 and the plant would begin generating power by May 2009.   > Bullard Energy Center also will connect to the PG&amp;E network and supply electricity under a 20-year deal. Construction is expected to begin in February 2008 and the plant would begin producing power by summer 2009.   > The third project is a $73.5 million, 128-MW repowering of the gas-fired El Centro Unit 3 power plant to be built by the Imperial Irrigation District. Construction is expected to begin in September 2007 and the plant could start producing power by May 2009.   > The CEC said the repowering project may obtain local permits under state law.     | projects, generating, open
